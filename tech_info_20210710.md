| 20210710T12:26:22Z | CVE-2020-3580 | Automated bulk IP or domain scanner for CVE 2020 3580. Cisco ASA and FTD XSS hunter. | https://github.com/adarshvs/CVE-2020-3580 | Multiple vulnerabilities in the web services interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the web services interface of an affected device. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web services interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information. Note: These vulnerabilities affect only specific AnyConnect and WebVPN configurations. For more information, see the Vulnerable Products section.| 
| 20210710T11:26:09Z | CVE-2020-7247 | PoC exploit for CVE-2020-7247 OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 < 6.6.1 Remote Code Execution | https://github.com/f4T1H21/CVE-2020-7247 | smtp_mailaddr in smtp_session.c in OpenSMTPD 6.6, as used in OpenBSD 6.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands as root via a crafted SMTP session, as demonstrated by shell metacharacters in a MAIL FROM field. This affects the %uncommented% default configuration. The issue exists because of an incorrect return value upon failure of input validation.| 
| 20210710T08:50:55Z | CVE-2021-1675 | C# and Impacket implementation of PrintNightmare CVE-2021-1675/CVE-2021-34527 | https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675 | Windows Print Spooler Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability| 
| 20210710T07:28:54Z | CVE-2020-14343 | Experimenting with the CVE-2020-14343 PyYAML vulnerability | https://github.com/raul23/pyyaml-CVE-2020-14343 | A vulnerability was discovered in the PyYAML library in versions before 5.4, where it is susceptible to arbitrary code execution when it processes untrusted YAML files through the full_load method or with the FullLoader loader. Applications that use the library to process untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by abusing the python/object/new constructor. This flaw is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-1747.|
