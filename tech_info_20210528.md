| 20210528T16:54:26Z | CVE-2020-27208 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-27208 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2020-27208 | The flash read-out protection (RDP) level is not enforced during the device initialization phase of the SoloKeys Solo 4.0.0 & Somu and the Nitrokey FIDO2 token. This allows an adversary to downgrade the RDP level and access secrets such as private ECC keys from SRAM via the debug interface.| 
| 20210528T16:54:25Z | CVE-2021-29628 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-29628 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2021-29628 | In FreeBSD 13.0-STABLE before n245764-876ffe28796c, 12.2-STABLE before r369857, 13.0-RELEASE before p1, and 12.2-RELEASE before p7, a system call triggering a fault could cause SMAP protections to be disabled for the duration of the system call. This weakness could be combined with other kernel bugs to craft an exploit.| 
| 20210528T16:54:21Z | CVE-2020-12061 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-12061 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2020-12061 | An issue was discovered in Nitrokey FIDO U2F firmware through 1.1. Communication between the microcontroller and the secure element transmits credentials in plain. This allows an adversary to eavesdrop the communication and derive the secrets stored in the microcontroller. As a result, the attacker is able to arbitrarily manipulate the firmware of the microcontroller.|

It allows DNS rebinding. A remote web server can exploit this vulnerability to trick a victim%s browser into triggering actions against local UPnP services implemented using this library. Depending on the affected service, this could be used for data exfiltration, data tempering, etc.|

| 20210528T23:53:40Z | The generalized normal distribution is ruled by a parameter %beta% and comprises famous distributions, such as normal (beta=2) and Laplace (beta=1). The uniform distribution is also included, as beta diverges. Current implementation in R package gnorm exploits relation with gamma distribution to simulate random draws. This implementation is proner to break down as beta diverges. For beta >= 1, the GN density is log-concave, so I propose a rng based on Devroye%s method. This alternative implementation does not break down as beta diverges. It is also provides an educational example of application for Devroye%s elegant and general method. | https://github.com/mlambardi/gnorm | 0 | 0|
