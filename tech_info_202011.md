| 20201102T02:01:09Z | RGraph is an RDMA-assisted asynchronous distributed graph processing system. RGraph distributes edges into two parts to isolate master and mirror vertices. RGraph exploits the asymmetry of RDMA to accelerate the one-to-many communication between master and mirror vertices.  The results in comprehensive experiments show that compared to existing designs, PowerGraph, RGraph reduces the execution time by up to 81%. | https://github.com/CGCL-codes/RGraph | 1 | 2|
