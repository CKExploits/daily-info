| 20210815T11:21:59Z | A SQL Injection attack consists of the insertion or injection of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input to affect the execution of predefined SQL commands. | https://github.com/pierceoneill/SQL-injection | 0 | 0|
