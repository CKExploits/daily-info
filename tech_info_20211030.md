| 20211030T22:05:42Z | The first thing every penetration tester performs getting into a controller domain subnet is to brute force discovery of users which is called a Kerbrute attack.

I tried to fill this gap by creating a universal working dictionary for Kerbrute attack in the Russian AD. | https://github.com/IvanGlinkin/Dics-for-Russian-AD | 0 | 0|
