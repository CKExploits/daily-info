The simple route is so simple, all you need to do is download the build folder on the release page and change the configuration to fit your needs. (Follow the video for a walk through).  The more complex route allows you to add additional functionality if you are comfortable with coding in react.js.

| 20220803T11:57:58Z | Face super-resolution (FSR) is dedicated to the restoration of high-resolution (HR) face images from their low-resolution (LR) coun- terparts. Many deep FSR methods exploit facial prior knowledge (e.g., facial landmark and parsing map) related to facial structure information to generate HR face images. However, directly training a facial prior es- timation network with deep FSR model requires manually labeled data, and is often computationally expensive. In addition, inaccurate facial pri- ors may degrade super-resolution performance. In this paper, we propose a residual FSR method with spatial attention mechanism guided by mul- tiscale receptive-field features (MRF) for converting LR face images (i.e., 16 × 16) to HR face images (i.e., 128 × 128). With our spatial attention mechanism, we can recover local details in face images without explicitly learning the prior knowledge. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FSR method | https://github.com/SYLan2019/MRRNet | 1 | 0|
