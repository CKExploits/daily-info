| 20210604T11:26:42Z | CVE-2021-29447 | Wordpress XXE injection 구축 자동화 및 PoC  | https://github.com/dnr6419/CVE-2021-29447 | Wordpress is an open source CMS. A user with the ability to upload files (like an Author) can exploit an XML parsing issue in the Media Library leading to XXE attacks. This requires WordPress installation to be using PHP 8. Access to internal files is possible in a successful XXE attack. This has been patched in WordPress version 5.7.1, along with the older affected versions via a minor release. We strongly recommend you keep auto-updates enabled.| 
| 20210604T11:20:32Z | CVE-2021-21985 | Null | https://github.com/alt3kx/CVE-2021-21985_PoC | The vSphere Client (HTML5) contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to lack of input validation in the Virtual SAN Health Check plug-in which is enabled by default in vCenter Server.

Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.0.2, 12.2.0.1, 18c and 19c. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker having DBA Level Account privilege with network access via Oracle Net to compromise Recovery. While the vulnerability is in Recovery, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Recovery accessible data. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 4.1 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N).|

Local authenticated user access is required.| 
| 20210603T14:20:48Z | CVE-2020-36326 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-36326 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2020-36326 | PHPMailer 6.1.8 through 6.4.0 allows object injection through Phar Deserialization via addAttachment with a UNC pathname. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2018-19296, but arose because 6.1.8 fixed a functionality problem in which UNC pathnames were always considered unreadable by PHPMailer, even in safe contexts. As an unintended side effect, this fix eliminated the code that blocked addAttachment exploitation.|
