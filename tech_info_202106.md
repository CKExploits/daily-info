| 20210608T01:09:50Z | CVE-2021-3277 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-3277 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-3277 | Nagios XI 5.7.5 and earlier allows authenticated admins to upload arbitrary files due to improper validation of the rename functionality in custom-includes component, which leads to remote code execution by uploading php files.| 
| 20210608T01:09:44Z | CVE-2021-32671 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-32671 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-32671 | Flarum is a forum software for building communities. Flarum%s translation system allowed for string inputs to be converted into HTML DOM nodes when rendered. This change was made after v0.1.0-beta.16 (our last beta before v1.0.0) and was not noticed or documented. This allowed for any user to type malicious HTML markup within certain user input fields and have this execute on client browsers. The example which led to the discovery of this vulnerability was in the forum search box. Entering faux-malicious HTML markup, such as <script>alert(%test%)</script> resulted in an alert box appearing on the forum. This attack could also be modified to perform AJAX requests on behalf of a user, possibly deleting discussions, modifying their settings or profile, or even modifying settings on the Admin panel if the attack was targetted towards a privileged user. All Flarum communities that run flarum v1.0.0 or v1.0.1 are impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed and published as flarum/core v1.0.2. All communities running Flarum v1.0 have to upgrade as soon as possible to v1.0.2.| 
| 20210608T01:09:33Z | CVE-2021-32670 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-32670 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-32670 | Datasette is an open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data. The `?_trace=1` debugging feature in Datasette does not correctly escape generated HTML, resulting in a [reflected cross-site scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/#reflected-xss-attacks) vulnerability. This vulnerability is particularly relevant if your Datasette installation includes authenticated features using plugins such as [datasette-auth-passwords](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords) as an attacker could use the vulnerability to access protected data. Datasette 0.57 and 0.56.1 both include patches for this issue. If you run Datasette behind a proxy you can workaround this issue by rejecting any incoming requests with `?_trace=` or `&_trace=` in their query string parameters.|
