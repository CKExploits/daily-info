| 20210606T08:51:32Z | CVE-2020-13957 | Apache Solr RCE CVE-2020-13957 | https://github.com/s-index/CVE-2020-13957 | Apache Solr versions 6.6.0 to 6.6.6, 7.0.0 to 7.7.3 and 8.0.0 to 8.6.2 prevents some features considered dangerous (which could be used for remote code execution) to be configured in a ConfigSet that%s uploaded via API without authentication/authorization. The checks in place to prevent such features can be circumvented by using a combination of UPLOAD/CREATE actions.| 
| 20210606T08:41:21Z | CVE-2021-25641 | Apache/Alibaba Dubbo <= 2.7.3 PoC Code for CVE-2021-25641 RCE via Deserialization of Untrusted Data; Affects Versions <= 2.7.6 With Different Gadgets | https://github.com/Dor-Tumarkin/CVE-2021-25641-Proof-of-Concept | Each Apache Dubbo server will set a serialization id to tell the clients which serialization protocol it is working on. But for Dubbo versions before 2.7.8 or 2.6.9, an attacker can choose which serialization id the Provider will use by tampering with the byte preamble flags, aka, not following the server%s instruction. This means that if a weak deserializer such as the Kryo and FST are somehow in code scope (e.g. if Kryo is somehow a part of a dependency), a remote unauthenticated attacker can tell the Provider to use the weak deserializer, and then proceed to exploit it.| 
| 20210606T08:09:03Z | CVE-2021-21551 | arbitrary kernel read/write in dbutil_2_3.sys, Proof of Concept Local Privilege Escalation to nt authority/system | https://github.com/mathisvickie/CVE-2021-21551 | Dell dbutil_2_3.sys driver contains an insufficient access control vulnerability which may lead to escalation of privileges, denial of service, or information disclosure. Local authenticated user access is required.|

GitLab was not properly validating image files that were passed to a file parser which resulted in a remote command execution.| 
| 20210606T03:42:20Z | CVE-2021-29440 | Unsafe Twig processing of static pages leading to RCE in Grav CMS 1.7.10 | https://github.com/CsEnox/CVE-2021-29440 | Grav is a file based Web-platform. Twig processing of static pages can be enabled in the front matter by any administrative user allowed to create or edit pages. As the Twig processor runs unsandboxed, this behavior can be used to gain arbitrary code execution and elevate privileges on the instance. The issue was addressed in version 1.7.11.| 
| 20210606T00:30:45Z | CVE-2021-22911 | Pre-Auth Blind NoSQL Injection leading to Remote Code Execution in Rocket Chat 3.12.1 | https://github.com/CsEnox/CVE-2021-22911 | A improper input sanitization vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat server 3.11, 3.12 & 3.13 that could lead to unauthenticated NoSQL injection, resulting potentially in RCE.| 
| 20210605T12:21:10Z | CVE-2021-30513 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-30513 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-30513 | Type confusion in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.212 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.|

The main goal of using the chaotic maps in the proposed method is to improve the exploratory behavior of HHO. In addition, this paper introduces a nonlinear control parameter to adjust HHO’s exploratory and exploitative behaviours. The proposed NCHHO algorithm shows an improved performance using a variety of chaotic maps that were implemented to identify the most effective one, and tested on several well-known benchmark functions. Also, this work considers solving an Internet of Vehicles (IoV) optimization problem that showcases the applicability of NCHHO in solving large-scale, real-world problems. | https://github.com/alisafaa12/NCHHO_OptimizationAlgorithm_IoV_Application | 0 | 0|
