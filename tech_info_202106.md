An adversary  who successfully exploits the vulnerability could  run arbitrary code or malicious code in the  context of the Local System Account. And this  vulnerability rests on the DNS client while it  handles specific requests. This means that an  attacker who does not perform an  authentication can gain control of an account  that exists locally on the system, even remotely.  This will allow the host to reach a complete  compromise. T | https://github.com/ejlevin99/CVE---2020---1350 | 未查询到CVE信息|

The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web services interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information. Note: These vulnerabilities affect only specific AnyConnect and WebVPN configurations. For more information, see the Vulnerable Products section.|
