| 20210605T12:19:05Z | CVE-2021-25328 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-25328 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-25328 | Skyworth Digital Technology RN510 V.3.1.0.4 RN510 V.3.1.0.4 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in /cgi-bin/app-staticIP.asp. An authenticated attacker can send a specially crafted request to endpoint which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) or possible code execution on the device.| 
| 20210605T12:19:04Z | CVE-2021-25327 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-25327 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-25327 | Skyworth Digital Technology RN510 V.3.1.0.4 contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in /cgi-bin/net-routeadd.asp and /cgi-bin/sec-urlfilter.asp. Missing CSRF protection in devices can lead to XSRF, as the above pages are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).| 
| 20210605T12:19:02Z | CVE-2020-13558 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-13558 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2020-13558 | A code execution vulnerability exists in the AudioSourceProviderGStreamer functionality of Webkit WebKitGTK 2.30.1. A specially crafted web page can lead to a use after free.| 
| 20210605T12:18:58Z | CVE-2021-23983 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-23983 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-23983 | By causing a transition on a parent node by removing a CSS rule, an invalid property for a marker could have been applied, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 87.| 
| 20210605T12:18:54Z | CVE-2021-30159 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-30159 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-30159 | An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.2. Users can bypass intended restrictions on deleting pages in certain %fast double move% situations. MovePage::isValidMoveTarget() uses FOR UPDATE, but it%s only called if Title::getArticleID() returns non-zero with no special flags. Next, MovePage::moveToInternal() will delete the page if getArticleID(READ_LATEST) is non-zero. Therefore, if the page is missing in the replica DB, isValidMove() will return true, and then moveToInternal() will unconditionally delete the page if it can be found in the master.| 
| 20210605T12:18:51Z | CVE-2021-30178 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-30178 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-30178 | An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.11. synic_get in arch/x86/kvm/hyperv.c has a NULL pointer dereference for certain accesses to the SynIC Hyper-V context, aka CID-919f4ebc5987.| 
| 20210605T12:18:48Z | CVE-2021-3393 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-3393 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-3393 | An information leak was discovered in postgresql in versions before 13.2, before 12.6 and before 11.11. A user having UPDATE permission but not SELECT permission to a particular column could craft queries which, under some circumstances, might disclose values from that column in error messages. An attacker could use this flaw to obtain information stored in a column they are allowed to write but not read.| 
| 20210605T12:18:33Z | CVE-2021-3448 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-3448 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-3448 | A flaw was found in dnsmasq in versions before 2.85. When configured to use a specific server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a fixed port while forwarding queries. An attacker on the network, able to find the outgoing port used by dnsmasq, only needs to guess the random transmission ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw makes a DNS Cache Poisoning attack much easier. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.| 
| 20210605T12:18:29Z | CVE-2021-30123 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-30123 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-30123 | FFmpeg <=4.3 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in libavcodec through a crafted file that may lead to remote code execution.|
