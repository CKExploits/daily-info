In systeminformation before version 5.3.1 there is a command injection vulnerability. Problem was fixed in version 5.3.1. As a workaround instead of upgrading, be sure to check or sanitize service parameters that are passed to si.inetLatency(), si.inetChecksite(), si.services(), si.processLoad() ... do only allow strings, reject any arrays. String sanitation works as expected.| 
| 20210608T21:45:07Z | CVE-2020-8835 | Formal verification example for CVE-2020-8835 | https://github.com/digamma-ai/CVE-2020-8835-verification | In the Linux kernel 5.5.0 and newer, the bpf verifier (kernel/bpf/verifier.c) did not properly restrict the register bounds for 32-bit operations, leading to out-of-bounds reads and writes in kernel memory. The vulnerability also affects the Linux 5.4 stable series, starting with v5.4.7, as the introducing commit was backported to that branch. This vulnerability was fixed in 5.6.1, 5.5.14, and 5.4.29.

| 20210608T15:34:26Z | CVE-2021-26714 | Directory Traversal vulnerability in Enterprise License Manager portal in Mitel MiContact Center Enterprise before 9.4 | https://github.com/PwCNO-CTO/CVE-2021-26714 | The Enterprise License Manager portal in Mitel MiContact Center Enterprise before 9.4 could allow a user to access restricted files and folders due to insufficient access control. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to view and modify application data via Directory Traversal.| 
| 20210608T15:32:10Z | CVE-2021-21234 | Directory traversal vulnerability in the spring-boot-actuator-logview library | https://github.com/PwCNO-CTO/CVE-2021-21234 | spring-boot-actuator-logview in a library that adds a simple logfile viewer as spring boot actuator endpoint. It is maven package %eu.hinsch:spring-boot-actuator-logview%. In spring-boot-actuator-logview before version 0.2.13 there is a directory traversal vulnerability. The nature of this library is to expose a log file directory via admin (spring boot actuator) HTTP endpoints. Both the filename to view and a base folder (relative to the logging folder root) can be specified via request parameters. While the filename parameter was checked to prevent directory traversal exploits (so that `filename=../somefile` would not work), the base folder parameter was not sufficiently checked, so that `filename=somefile&base=../` could access a file outside the logging base directory). The vulnerability has been patched in release 0.2.13. Any users of 0.2.12 should be able to update without any issues as there are no other changes in that release. There is no workaround to fix the vulnerability other than updating or removing the dependency. However, removing read access of the user the application is run with to any directory not required for running the application can limit the impact. Additionally, access to the logview endpoint can be limited by deploying the application behind a reverse proxy.|

A vulnerability in XStream versions prior to 1.4.17 may allow a remote attacker has sufficient rights to execute commands of the host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user who followed the recommendation to setup XStream%s security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types is affected. The vulnerability is patched in version 1.4.17.|
