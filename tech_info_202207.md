| 20220718T21:12:12Z | The multi-armed bandit problem provides a fundamental concept for reinforcement learning.  The problem setting is that there are multiple actions that can be taken and the distribution of rewards given the action are unknown.  In this case, uncertainty is at its extreme but we must find the most optimal action to take over the long-run.  The problem constitutes a trade-off between exploration and exploitation when making decisions under uncertainty.  The goal of the project was aimed at programming an agent to find the most optimal action by making decisions based on exploration and exploitation probabilities and ultimately find the best strategy for a basket of test-bed multi-armed bandit problems.   | https://github.com/laz-ai/reinforcement-learning | 0 | 0|

| 20220717T12:31:48Z | During the exploitation phase of a pen test or ethical hacking engagement, you will ultimately need to try to cause code to run on target system computers. Whether accomplished by phishing emails, delivering a payload through an exploit, or social engineering, running code on target computers is part of most penetration tests. That means that you will need to be able to bypass antivirus software or other host-based protection for successful exploitation. The most effective way to avoid antivirus detection on your target%s computers is to create your own customized backdoor.
