| 20220610T00:10:37Z | URL Infection (Silent Java Drive By) URL Infection Exploit Silent Java Drive by downloads may happen when visiting a site, opening an e-mail message. It may even happen by clicking on a malicious pop-up window: by clicking on the window in the belief that it concerns an error report from the computer’s OS, for example. The next step is to host the malicious content that the attacker wishes to “share”. One option is for the attacker to host the malicious content on their own server. However, it’s rather difficult directing users to a new page, so an exposed legal website may also host it. Or even a legal website could be distributing the attackers’ content through a third party service without knowing it. When the client loads the content, the attacker will analyze the trace of the client in order to craft the code to URL Infection Exploit weak spots especially to that client. Finally, the attacker exploits the needful weak spots to launch the drive-by download attack. | https://github.com/leokok10/Slient-Url-Exploit-New-Cve-Chrome-Exploit-Html-Downloader-Put-Your-Link | 0 | 0|
