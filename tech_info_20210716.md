| 20210716T15:24:16Z | CVE-2021-33560 | Tool to check whether a PGP client is affected by CVE-2021-33560 | https://github.com/IBM/PGP-client-checker-CVE-2021-33560 | Libgcrypt before 1.8.8 and 1.9.x before 1.9.3 mishandles ElGamal encryption because it lacks exponent blinding to address a side-channel attack against mpi_powm, and the window size is not chosen appropriately. (There is also an interoperability problem because the selection of the k integer value does not properly consider the differences between basic ElGamal encryption and generalized ElGamal encryption.) This, for example, affects use of ElGamal in OpenPGP.|
