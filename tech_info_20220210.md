| 20220210T12:32:14Z | This program evaluates the association strength of the bug-inducing and bug-fixing commit pairs for the datasets in the paper %Exploring and Exploiting the Correlations between Bug-Inducing and Bug-Fixing Commits%.  The goal is to ascertain how reliable code change-based datasets are for software bug prediction.  The average association strengths evaluated to be 0.262, 0.086, 0.726 and 0.048 for Apache Accumulo, Apache Ambari, Apache Lucene and Apache Oozie, respectively and yielding a cumulative average association strength of 0.280.  So, in summary, the individual association strength values varied from project to project. However, the low cumulative average association strength indicates that code change-based datasets may not be as reliable as we think. So, the recommendation is that researchers conduct this experiment before using any code change-based dataset in their study. | https://github.com/chizzymeka/association-rule-mining-experiment | 0 | 0|
