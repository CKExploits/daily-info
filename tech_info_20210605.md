| 20210605T12:20:15Z | CVE-2021-20585 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-20585 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-20585 | IBM Security Verify Access 20.07 could disclose sensitive information in HTTP server headers that could be used in further attacks against the system. IBM X-Force ID: 199398.| 
| 20210605T12:20:11Z | CVE-2021-25326 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-25326 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-25326 | Skyworth Digital Technology RN510 V.3.1.0.4 is affected by an incorrect access control vulnerability in/cgi-bin/test_version.asp. If Wi-Fi is connected but an unauthenticated user visits a URL, the SSID password and web UI password may be disclosed.| 
| 20210605T12:19:43Z | CVE-2021-28242 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-28242 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-28242 | SQL Injection in the %evoadm.php% component of b2evolution v7.2.2-stable allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive database information by injecting SQL commands into the %cf_name% parameter when creating a new filter under the %Collections% tab.| 
| 20210605T12:19:35Z | CVE-2021-23985 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-23985 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-23985 | If an attacker is able to alter specific about:config values (for example malware running on the user%s computer), the Devtools remote debugging feature could have been enabled in a way that was unnoticable to the user. This would have allowed a remote attacker (able to make a direct network connection to the victim) to monitor the user%s browsing activity and (plaintext) network traffic. This was addressed by providing a visual cue when Devtools has an open network socket. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 87.| 
| 20210605T12:19:31Z | CVE-2021-23987 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-23987 | https://github.com/JamesGeeee/CVE-2021-23987 | Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 86 and Firefox ESR 78.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.9, Thunderbird < 78.9, and Firefox < 87.|
