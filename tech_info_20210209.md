| 20210209T21:09:29Z | CVE-2020-8835 | Null | https://github.com/ret2hell/CVE-2020-8835 | In the Linux kernel 5.5.0 and newer, the bpf verifier (kernel/bpf/verifier.c) did not properly restrict the register bounds for 32-bit operations, leading to out-of-bounds reads and writes in kernel memory. The vulnerability also affects the Linux 5.4 stable series, starting with v5.4.7, as the introducing commit was backported to that branch. This vulnerability was fixed in 5.6.1, 5.5.14, and 5.4.29. (issue is aka ZDI-CAN-10780)| 
| 20210209T18:48:13Z | CVE-2020-1350 | HoneyPoC: Proof-of-Concept (PoC) script to exploit SIGRed (CVE-2020-1350).

| 20210209T03:15:11Z | CVE-2020-17527 | Null | https://github.com/forse01/CVE-2020-17527-Tomcat | While investigating bug 64830 it was discovered that Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M9, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.39 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.59 could re-use an HTTP request header value from the previous stream received on an HTTP/2 connection for the request associated with the subsequent stream. While this would most likely lead to an error and the closure of the HTTP/2 connection, it is possible that information could leak between requests.| 
| 20210209T03:14:51Z | CVE-2020-25213 | Null | https://github.com/forse01/CVE-2020-25213-Wordpress | The File Manager (wp-file-manager) plugin before 6.9 for WordPress allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code because it renames an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have the .php extension. This, for example, allows attackers to run the elFinder upload (or mkfile and put) command to write PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This was exploited in the wild in August and September 2020.|
