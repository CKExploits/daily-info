| 20210109T13:54:32Z | CVE-2020-7048 | Null | https://github.com/ElmouradiAmine/CVE-2020-7048 | The WordPress plugin, WP Database Reset through 3.1, contains a flaw that allowed any unauthenticated user to reset any table in the database to the initial WordPress set-up state (deleting all site content stored in that table), as demonstrated by a wp-admin/admin-post.php?db-reset-tables[]=comments URI.| 
| 20210109T10:35:20Z | CVE-2020-11851 | Remote Code Execution vulnerability on ArcSight Logger | https://github.com/ch1nghz/CVE-2020-11851 | | 
| 20210109T08:43:55Z | CVE-2020-3452 | CISCO CVE-2020-3452 Scanner & Exploiter | https://github.com/darklotuskdb/CISCO-CVE-2020-3452-Scanner-Exploiter | A vulnerability in the web services interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks and read sensitive files on a targeted system. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.| 
| 20210109T08:37:55Z | CVE-2020-14179 | CVE-2020-14179 Scanner | https://github.com/c0brabaghdad1/CVE-2020-14179 | Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center allow remote, unauthenticated attackers to view custom field names and custom SLA names via an Information Disclosure vulnerability in the /secure/QueryComponent!Default.jspa endpoint. The affected versions are before version 8.5.8, and from version 8.6.0 before 8.11.1.|

| 20210109T06:55:14Z | CVE-2020-25498 | Stored XSS via CSRF in Beetel 777VR1 Router  | https://github.com/the-girl-who-lived/CVE-2020-25498 | Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Beetel router 777VR1 can be exploited via the NTP server name in System Time and %Keyword% in URL Filter.| 
| 20210108T23:15:08Z | CVE-2020-29254 | TikiWiki 21.2 allows to edit templates without the use of a CSRF protection.  | https://github.com/S1lkys/CVE-2020-29254 | TikiWiki 21.2 allows templates to be edited without CSRF protection. This could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected system with the privileges of the user. These action include allowing attackers to submit their own code through an authenticated user resulting in local file Inclusion. If an authenticated user who is able to edit TikiWiki templates visits an malicious website, template code can be edited.|

| 20210108T11:45:49Z | CVE-2020-17519 | Apache Flink 目录遍历漏洞批量检测 (CVE-2020-17519) | https://github.com/B1anda0/CVE-2020-17519 | A change introduced in Apache Flink 1.11.0 (and released in 1.11.1 and 1.11.2 as well) allows attackers to read any file on the local filesystem of the JobManager through the REST interface of the JobManager process. Access is restricted to files accessible by the JobManager process. All users should upgrade to Flink 1.11.3 or 1.12.0 if their Flink instance(s) are exposed. The issue was fixed in commit b561010b0ee741543c3953306037f00d7a9f0801 from apache/flink:master.|
