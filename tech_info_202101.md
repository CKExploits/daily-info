The vulnerability could be remotely exploited resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.| 
| 20210107T11:38:11Z | CVE-2020-29583 | Scanner for Zyxel products which are potentially vulnerable due to an undocumented user account (CVE-2020-29583) | https://github.com/2d4d/scan_CVE-2020-29583 | Firmware version 4.60 of Zyxel USG devices contains an undocumented account (zyfwp) with an unchangeable password. The password for this account can be found in cleartext in the firmware. This account can be used by someone to login to the ssh server or web interface with admin privileges.| 
| 20210107T09:58:53Z | CVE-2020-0001 | POC to run system component in an untrusted-app process | https://github.com/Zachinio/CVE-2020-0001 | In getProcessRecordLocked of ActivityManagerService.java isolated apps are not handled correctly. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android Versions: Android-8.0, Android-8.1, Android-9, and Android-10 Android ID: A-140055304| 
| 20210107T09:38:43Z | CVE-2020-3452 | CISCO CVE-2020-3452 Scanner & Exploiter | https://github.com/darklotuskdb/CISCO-CVE-2020-3452-Scanner-Exploiter | A vulnerability in the web services interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks and read sensitive files on a targeted system. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.|
