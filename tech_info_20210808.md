| 20210808T01:30:27Z | CVE-2020-27153 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-27153 : In BlueZ before 5.55, a double free was found in the gatttool disconnect_cb() routine from shared/att.c. A remote attacker could potentially cause a denial of service or code execution, during service discovery, due to a redundant disconnect MGMT event. | https://github.com/AlAIAL90/CVE-2020-27153 | In BlueZ before 5.55, a double free was found in the gatttool disconnect_cb() routine from shared/att.c.

| 20210808T01:30:23Z | CVE-2020-26558 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-26558 : Bluetooth LE and BR/EDR secure pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification 2.1 through 5.2 may permit a nearby man-in-the-middle attacker to identify the Passkey used during pairing (in the Passkey authentication procedure) by reflection of the public key and the authentication evidence of the initiating device, potentially permitting this attacker to complete authenticated pairing with the responding device using the correct Passkey for the pairing session. The attack methodology determines the Passkey value one bit at a time. | https://github.com/AlAIAL90/CVE-2020-26558 | Bluetooth LE and BR/EDR secure pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification 2.1 through 5.2 may permit a nearby man-in-the-middle attacker to identify the Passkey used during pairing (in the Passkey authentication procedure) by reflection of the public key and the authentication evidence of the initiating device, potentially permitting this attacker to complete authenticated pairing with the responding device using the correct Passkey for the pairing session.
