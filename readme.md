HME exploits features available in commodity NUMA architectures to emulate two kinds of memories: fast, local DRAM, and slower, remote NVM on other NUMA nodes. HME can emulates a wide range of NVM latencies and bandwidth by injecting different memory access delay on the remote NUMA nodes. To facilitate programmers and researchers in evaluating the impact of NVM on the application performance, a high-level programming interface is also provided to allocate memory from NVM or DRAM nodes. | https://github.com/CGCL-codes/HME | 40 | 12|
