| 20210921T23:49:11Z | CVE-2021-38647 | CVE-2021-38647 - POC to exploit unauthenticated RCE #OMIGOD | https://github.com/AlteredSecurity/CVE-2021-38647 | Open Management Infrastructure Remote Code Execution Vulnerability| 
| 20210921T20:09:55Z | CVE-2021-40444 | Modified code so that we don´t need to rely on CAB archives | https://github.com/Edubr2020/CVE-2021-40444--CABless | Microsoft MSHTML Remote Code Execution Vulnerability| 
| 20210921T11:43:41Z | CVE-2021-24499 | Mass exploitation of CVE-2021-24499 unauthenticated upload leading to remote code execution in Workreap theme. | https://github.com/RyouYoo/CVE-2021-24499 | The Workreap WordPress theme before 2.2.2 AJAX actions workreap_award_temp_file_uploader and workreap_temp_file_uploader did not perform nonce checks, or validate that the request is from a valid user in any other way. The endpoints allowed for uploading arbitrary files to the uploads/workreap-temp directory. Uploaded files were neither sanitized nor validated, allowing an unauthenticated visitor to upload executable code such as php scripts.| 
| 20210921T10:00:33Z | CVE-2021-22925 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-22925 : curl supports the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS`in libcurl. This rarely used option is used to send variable=content pairs toTELNET servers.Due to flaw in the option parser for sending `NEW_ENV` variables, libcurlcould be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to theserver. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to theserver using a clear-text network protocol.This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly whenparsing the string provided by the application. | https://github.com/AlAIAL90/CVE-2021-22925 | curl supports the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS`in libcurl.
