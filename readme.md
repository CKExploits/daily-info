| 20200823T21:53:21Z | A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the HTTP protocol stack (HTTP.sys) that is caused when HTTP.sys improperly parses specially crafted HTTP requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the context of the System account.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the affected system. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the Windows HTTP stack handles requests. | https://github.com/jc-base4sec/MS15-034 | 1 | 0|
