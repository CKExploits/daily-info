| 20210603T21:50:40Z | CVE-2021-21985 | Null | https://github.com/alt3kx/CVE-2021-21985_PoC | The vSphere Client (HTML5) contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to lack of input validation in the Virtual SAN Health Check plug-in which is enabled by default in vCenter Server. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server.|

| 20210603T17:32:25Z | CVE-2021-27965 | stack based buffer overflow in MsIo64.sys, Proof of Concept Local Privilege Escalation to nt authority/system | https://github.com/mathisvickie/CVE-2021-27965 | The MsIo64.sys driver before 1.1.19.1016 in MSI Dragon Center before 2.0.98.0 has a buffer overflow that allows privilege escalation via a crafted 0x80102040, 0x80102044, 0x80102050, or 0x80102054 IOCTL request.| 
| 20210603T17:32:02Z | CVE-2021-21551 | arbitrary kernel read/write in dbutil_2_3.sys, Proof of Concept Local Privilege Escalation to nt authority/system | https://github.com/mathisvickie/CVE-2021-21551 | Dell dbutil_2_3.sys driver contains an insufficient access control vulnerability which may lead to escalation of privileges, denial of service, or information disclosure. Local authenticated user access is required.| 
| 20210603T14:20:48Z | CVE-2020-36326 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-36326 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2020-36326 | PHPMailer 6.1.8 through 6.4.0 allows object injection through Phar Deserialization via addAttachment with a UNC pathname. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2018-19296, but arose because 6.1.8 fixed a functionality problem in which UNC pathnames were always considered unreadable by PHPMailer, even in safe contexts. As an unintended side effect, this fix eliminated the code that blocked addAttachment exploitation.| 
| 20210603T13:43:17Z | cve-2021-21985 | cve-2021-21985 exploit | https://github.com/xnianq/cve-2021-21985_exp | The vSphere Client (HTML5) contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to lack of input validation in the Virtual SAN Health Check plug-in which is enabled by default in vCenter Server. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server.| 
| 20210603T11:37:30Z | CVE-2020-7471 | PoC for the SQL injection vulnerability in PostgreSQL with Django, found in Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 | https://github.com/huzaifakhan771/CVE-2020-7471-Django | Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.| 
| 20210603T09:50:31Z | CVE-2020-24949 | PHPFusion 9.03.50 - Remote Code Execution | https://github.com/r90tpass/CVE-2020-24949 | Privilege escalation in PHP-Fusion 9.03.50 downloads/downloads.php allows an authenticated user (not admin) to send a crafted request to the server and perform remote command execution (RCE).|
