| 20210110T12:53:56Z | CVE-2020-36179 | CVE-2020-36179~82  Jackson-databind SSRF&RCE | https://github.com/Al1ex/CVE-2020-36179 | FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.10.8 mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to oadd.org.apache.commons.dbcp.cpdsadapter.DriverAdapterCPDS.|

| 20210110T09:14:10Z | CVE-2020-3452 | CISCO CVE-2020-3452 Scanner & Exploiter | https://github.com/darklotuskdb/CISCO-CVE-2020-3452-Scanner-Exploiter | A vulnerability in the web services interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks and read sensitive files on a targeted system. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.| 
| 20210110T05:34:59Z | CVE-2021-1056 | PoC for CVE-2021-1056 | https://github.com/pokerfaceSad/CVE-2021-1056 | NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux, all versions, contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko) in which it does not completely honor operating system file system permissions to provide GPU device-level isolation, which may lead to denial of service or information disclosure.| 
| 20210110T04:01:01Z | CVE-2020-11851 | Remote Code Execution vulnerability on ArcSight Logger | https://github.com/ch1nghz/CVE-2020-11851 | Arbitrary code execution vulnerability on Micro Focus ArcSight Logger product, affecting all version prior to 7.1.1. The vulnerability could be remotely exploited resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.| 
| 20210110T01:26:10Z | CVE-2020-17519 | [CVE-2020-17519] Apache Flink RESTful API Arbitrary File Read | https://github.com/murataydemir/CVE-2020-17519 | A change introduced in Apache Flink 1.11.0 (and released in 1.11.1 and 1.11.2 as well) allows attackers to read any file on the local filesystem of the JobManager through the REST interface of the JobManager process. Access is restricted to files accessible by the JobManager process. All users should upgrade to Flink 1.11.3 or 1.12.0 if their Flink instance(s) are exposed. The issue was fixed in commit b561010b0ee741543c3953306037f00d7a9f0801 from apache/flink:master.| 
| 20210110T01:18:11Z | CVE-2020-17518 | [CVE-2020-17518] Apache Flink RESTful API Arbitrary File Upload via Directory Traversal | https://github.com/murataydemir/CVE-2020-17518 | Apache Flink 1.5.1 introduced a REST handler that allows you to write an uploaded file to an arbitrary location on the local file system, through a maliciously modified HTTP HEADER. The files can be written to any location accessible by Flink 1.5.1. All users should upgrade to Flink 1.11.3 or 1.12.0 if their Flink instance(s) are exposed. The issue was fixed in commit a5264a6f41524afe8ceadf1d8ddc8c80f323ebc4 from apache/flink:master.|
