| 20211005T11:17:34Z | CVE-2021-39204 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-39204 : Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, incorrectly handles resetting of HTTP/2 streams with excessive complexity. This can lead to high CPU utilization when a large number of streams are reset. This can result in a DoS condition. Pomerium versions 0.14.8 and 0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with this vulnerability patched. | https://github.com/AIPOCAI/CVE-2021-39204 | | 
| 20211005T11:17:30Z | CVE-2021-39206 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-39206 : Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium. Pomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched. This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy. Removing any such policies should provide mitigation. | https://github.com/AIPOCAI/CVE-2021-39206 | | 
| 20211005T11:17:26Z | CVE-2021-22005 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-22005 : The vCenter Server contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the Analytics service.

| 20211005T11:17:22Z | CVE-2021-40965 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-40965 : A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in TinyFileManager all version up to and including 2.4.6 that allows attackers to upload files and run OS commands by inducing the Administrator user to browse a URL controlled by an attacker. | https://github.com/AIPOCAI/CVE-2021-40965 | | 
| 20211005T11:17:19Z | CVE-2020-14119 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-14119 : There is command injection in the addMeshNode interface of xqnetwork.lua, which leads to command execution under administrator authority on Xiaomi router AX3600 with rom versionrom< 1.1.12 | https://github.com/AIPOCAI/CVE-2020-14119 | | 
| 20211005T11:17:10Z | CVE-2021-40966 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-40966 : A Stored XSS exists in TinyFileManager All version up to and including 2.4.6 in /tinyfilemanager.php when the server is given a file that contains HTML and javascript in its name. A malicious user can upload a file with a malicious filename containing javascript code and it will run on any user browser when they access the server. | https://github.com/AIPOCAI/CVE-2021-40966 | | 
| 20211005T11:17:02Z | CVE-2021-33693 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-33693 : SAP Cloud Connector, version - 2.0, allows an authenticated administrator to modify a configuration file to inject malicious codes that could potentially lead to OS command execution. | https://github.com/AIPOCAI/CVE-2021-33693 | | 
| 20211005T11:16:55Z | CVE-2020-21481 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-21481 : An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in RGCMS v1.06 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .txt file which is later changed to a PHP file. | https://github.com/AIPOCAI/CVE-2020-21481 | | 
| 20211005T11:16:52Z | CVE-2021-24620 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-24620 : The WordPress Simple Ecommerce Shopping Cart Plugin- Sell products through Paypal plugin through 2.2.5 does not check for the uploaded Downloadable Digital product file, allowing any file, such as PHP to be uploaded by an administrator. Furthermore, as there is no CSRF in place, attackers could also make a logged admin upload a malicious PHP file, which would lead to RCE | https://github.com/AIPOCAI/CVE-2021-24620 | | 
| 20211005T11:16:47Z | CVE-2021-39239 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-39239 : A vulnerability in XML processing in Apache Jena, in versions up to 4.1.0, may allow an attacker to execute XML External Entities (XXE), including exposing the contents of local files to a remote server. | https://github.com/AIPOCAI/CVE-2021-39239 | |

| 20211005T11:17:15Z | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-39201 : WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. ### Impact The issue allows an authenticated but low-privileged user (like contributor/author) to execute XSS in the editor. This bypasses the restrictions imposed on users who do not have the permission to post `unfiltered_html`. ### Patches This has been patched in WordPress 5.8, and will be pushed to older versions via minor releases (automatic updates). It%s strongly recommended that you keep auto-updates enabled to receive the fix. ### References https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/ https://hackerone.com/reports/1142140 ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/wordpress) | https://github.com/AIPOCAI/CVE-2021-39201 | 0 | 0|
