| 20200801T20:34:05Z | We plan to specify grammars of inputs for three selected benchmarks, which share similar API and grammars of inputs. Then we will use these grammars as the seeds to generate well-formated inputs via gramfuzz, a Python-based grammer fuzzer, to penetrate deep into benchmarks’ parsers. We expect that some potential errors of benchmarks would be detected in this project. In addition, we plan to design a runner program, which can feed the inputs into the benchmarks automatically, as enhancements to gramfuzz. | https://github.com/alyssahyq/gramfuzz-calc | 0 | 0|
