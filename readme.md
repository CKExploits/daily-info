| 20210820T11:26:28Z | Anomaly event detection is vital in surveillance video analysis. However, how to learn the discriminative motion in the crowd scene is still not tackled. In this work, we propose a deep social force network by exploiting both social force extracting and deep motion coding. Given a grid of particles with velocity provided by the optical flow, we investigate the interaction force in the crowd scene and embed a social force module in a deep network. We further design a Deep Motion Convolution with a 3D (DMC-3D) module. The DMC-3D not only eliminates the noise motion in the crowd scene with a spatial encoder-decoder but also learns the 3D feature with a spatio-temporal encoder. We model the deep social force coding with multiple features, in which each feature can describe specific anomaly motion. The experiments on  UCF-Crime and ShanghaiTech datasets demonstrate that our method can predict the temporal localization of anomaly events and outperform the state-of-the-art methods. | https://github.com/wukewei1984/Deep-social-force-network-for-anomaly-event-detection | 0 | 0|
