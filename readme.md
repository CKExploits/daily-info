| 20210213T21:42:35Z | CVE-2020-36109 | PoC DoS CVE-2020-36109 | https://github.com/tin-z/CVE-2020-36109-POC | ASUS RT-AX86U router firmware below version under 9.0.0.4_386 has a buffer overflow in the blocking_request.cgi function of the httpd module that can cause code execution when an attacker constructs malicious data.| 
| 20210213T11:57:52Z | CVE-2021-25646 | Null | https://github.com/Vulnmachines/Apache-Druid-CVE-2021-25646 | Apache Druid includes the ability to execute user-provided JavaScript code embedded in various types of requests. This functionality is intended for use in high-trust environments, and is disabled by default. However, in Druid 0.20.0 and earlier, it is possible for an authenticated user to send a specially-crafted request that forces Druid to run user-provided JavaScript code for that request, regardless of server configuration. This can be leveraged to execute code on the target machine with the privileges of the Druid server process.|

Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution by an authenticated attacker. | https://github.com/HoangKien1020/CVE-2021-21014 | Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to a file upload restriction bypass. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution by an authenticated attacker. Access to the admin console is required for successful exploitation.| 
| 20210213T07:15:41Z | CVE-2020-7247 | OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 - 6.6.1 Remote Code Execution PoC exploit | https://github.com/QTranspose/CVE-2020-7247-exploit | smtp_mailaddr in smtp_session.c in OpenSMTPD 6.6, as used in OpenBSD 6.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands as root via a crafted SMTP session, as demonstrated by shell metacharacters in a MAIL FROM field. This affects the %uncommented% default configuration. The issue exists because of an incorrect return value upon failure of input validation.|
