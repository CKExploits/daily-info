| 20220424T09:33:12Z | Cloud computing is currently considered the most cost-effective platform for offering business and consumer IT services over the Internet. However, it is prone to new vulnerabilities. A new type of attack, called an economic denial of sustainability (EDoS) attack, exploits the pay-per-use model to scale up the resource usage over time to the extent that the cloud user has to pay for the unexpected usage charge. In this project, we proposed a two-phase deep learning-based detection system to detect EDoS attack. The first phase called the prediod detector will detect where there is an attack in a period of 5s and then trigger the second phase detector if there is an attack in that 5-second period. The second detector called the flow detector will detect abnormal flows in the abnormal period detected by the first detector. | https://github.com/harrychien1311/Two-phase-Deep-learning-based-EDoS-Detection-System | 0 | 0|

| 20220424T05:56:17Z | Warning Although the hacking community in general are pretty chill nice people there are a lot of bad actors on discord who sell fake things to try and scam people interested in hacking. People will sell things like fake %One Click% exploits for 50 dollars. Don%t fall victim to these please. I came up with the project idea after seeing tons of fake %One Click Image Loggers% being sold. Unless someone can prove me wrong pretty sure this is the closest we%ll get to a image logger on discord | https://github.com/H0QLCoder/Discord-Image-logger-mutil-tool | 0 | 0|
