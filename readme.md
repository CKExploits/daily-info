| 20220317T11:03:58Z | We use Arduino MCU to design a device that can accurately monitor the occurrence of fire and feed back information to users in real time. When the temperature of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the site exceeds the threshold value, we will immediately monitor the temperature of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in combination with the temperature of the site, the infrared sensor, and the corresponding data of the smoke sensor, After signal preprocessing, the information is transmitted to Arduino processor for intelligent comprehensive analysis, and then send data to users through hc-06 Bluetooth module and store historical data, so that users can monitor the state of forest at any time to monitor and prevent forest fire. The forest alarm is more intelligent and convenient to use, reducing the waste of material and human resources. Due to the high accuracy of the sensor and wide application scenarios, the accuracy of judging whether a fire occurs is more strengthened, and it can be monitored 24 hours in a variety of environments. | https://github.com/jcllong/Forest-fire-detection-system-based-on-fuzzy-inference-algorithm | 0 | 0|
