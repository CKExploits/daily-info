| 20210218T10:17:18Z | CVE-2021-25646 | Null | https://github.com/hoanx4/apache_druid_rce_CVE-2021-25646 | Apache Druid includes the ability to execute user-provided JavaScript code embedded in various types of requests. This functionality is intended for use in high-trust environments, and is disabled by default. However, in Druid 0.20.0 and earlier, it is possible for an authenticated user to send a specially-crafted request that forces Druid to run user-provided JavaScript code for that request, regardless of server configuration. This can be leveraged to execute code on the target machine with the privileges of the Druid server process.| 
| 20210218T09:35:37Z | CVE-2020-8637 | Null | https://github.com/DXY0411/CVE-2020-8637 | A SQL injection vulnerability in TestLink 1.9.20 allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands in dragdroptreenodes.php via the node_id parameter.|

This is exploitable on sites using debug mode with Laravel before 8.4.2.|
