| 20210602T06:14:10Z | CVE-2020-14882 | CVE-2020-14882_Exploit 支持12.2.X和10.3.6版本，12.2.x可回显 | https://github.com/nice0e3/CVE-2020-14882_Exploit_Gui | Vulnerability in the Oracle WebLogic Server product of Oracle Fusion Middleware (component: Console). Supported versions that are affected are 10.3.6.0.0, 12.1.3.0.0, 12.2.1.3.0, 12.2.1.4.0 and 14.1.1.0.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle WebLogic Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Oracle WebLogic Server. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 9.8 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).| 
| 20210602T03:00:21Z | CVE-2020-25710 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-25710 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2020-25710 | A flaw was found in OpenLDAP in versions before 2.4.56. This flaw allows an attacker who sends a malicious packet processed by OpenLDAP to force a failed assertion in csnNormalize23(). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.| 
| 20210602T03:00:18Z | CVE-2021-32657 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-32657 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2021-32657 | Nextcloud Server is a Nextcloud package that handles data storage. In versions of Nextcloud Server prior to 10.0.11, 20.0.10, and 21.0.2, a malicious user may be able to break the user administration page. This would disallow administrators to administrate users on the Nextcloud instance. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 19.0.11, 20.0.10, and 21.0.2. As a workaround, administrators can use the OCC command line tool to administrate the Nextcloud users.| 
| 20210602T03:00:13Z | CVE-2021-30498 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-30498 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2021-30498 | A flaw was found in libcaca. A heap buffer overflow in export.c in function export_tga might lead to memory corruption and other potential consequences.| 
| 20210602T03:00:10Z | CVE-2021-32656 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-32656 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2021-32656 | Nextcloud Server is a Nextcloud package that handles data storage. A vulnerability in federated share exists in versions prior to 19.0.11, 20.0.10, and 21.0.2. An attacker can gain access to basic information about users of a server by accessing a public link that a legitimate server user added as a federated share. This happens because Nextcloud supports sharing registered users with other Nextcloud servers, which can be done automatically when selecting the %Add server automatically once a federated share was created successfully% setting. The vulnerability is patched in versions 19.0.11, 20.0.10, and 21.0.2 As a workaround, disable %Add server automatically once a federated share was created successfully% in the Nextcloud settings.| 
| 20210602T03:00:09Z | CVE-2021-29252 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-29252 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2021-29252 | RSA Archer before 6.9 SP1 P1 (6.9.1.1) contains a stored XSS vulnerability. A remote authenticated malicious Archer user with access to modify link name fields could potentially exploit this vulnerability to execute code in a victim%s browser.| 
| 20210602T00:24:54Z | CVE-2021-29447 | Wordpress XXE injection 구축 자동화 및 PoC  | https://github.com/dnr6419/CVE-2021-29447 | Wordpress is an open source CMS. A user with the ability to upload files (like an Author) can exploit an XML parsing issue in the Media Library leading to XXE attacks. This requires WordPress installation to be using PHP 8. Access to internal files is possible in a successful XXE attack. This has been patched in WordPress version 5.7.1, along with the older affected versions via a minor release. We strongly recommend you keep auto-updates enabled.|
