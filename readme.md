| 20210905T11:28:31Z | CVE-2021-26084 | Confluence Server Webwork OGNL injection | https://github.com/h3v0x/CVE-2021-26084_Confluence | In affected versions of Confluence Server and Data Center, an OGNL injection vulnerability exists that would allow an authenticated user, and in some instances an unauthenticated user, to execute arbitrary code on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance. The vulnerable endpoints can be accessed by a non-administrator user or unauthenticated user if ‚ÄòAllow people to sign up to create their account‚Äô is enabled. To check whether this is enabled go to COG > User Management > User Signup Options. The affected versions are before version 6.13.23, from version 6.14.0 before 7.4.11, from version 7.5.0 before 7.11.6, and from version 7.12.0 before 7.12.5.|

| 20210905T07:02:18Z | This project extracts the canvas data on https://www.osrsmap.net/ and converts each canvas display as an png file. This is done by exploiting html elements on the website and adding javascript parameter functions such as .toDataURL.   .toDataURL() method returns a data URI containing a representation of the image in the format specified by the type parameter (defaults to PNG).    WebDriver is an open source tool for automated testing of webapps across many browsers. It provides capabilities for navigating to web pages, user input, JavaScript execution, and more.     Download the chrome webdriver here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads   Base64 module allows for the script to This module provides functions for encoding binary data to printable ASCII characters and decoding such encodings back to binary data.    This is useful converting the canvas data to a png file.   The next function merges those images by looping the interactions of the canvas images, that results in the final product a full osrs map with icons and detailed. | https://github.com/slyautomation/astar_pathfinding_node_networks | 0 | 0|
