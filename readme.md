In Jellyfin before version 10.7.1, with certain endpoints, well crafted requests will allow arbitrary file read from a Jellyfin server%s file system. This issue is more prevalent when Windows is used as the host OS. Servers that are exposed to the public Internet are potentially at risk. This is fixed in version 10.7.1. As a workaround, users may be able to restrict some access by enforcing strict security permissions on their filesystem, however, it is recommended to update as soon as possible.|

| 20210410T10:39:52Z | ‚ÄúAI Based Facial Emotion Detection‚Äù, developed using many machine learning  algorithms including convolution neural networks (CNN) for a facial expression recognition task.  The goal is to classify each facial image into one of the seven facial emotion categories considered  in this study.Trained CNN models with different depth using gray-scale images from the Kaggle  website.CNN models are developed in Pytorch and exploited Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)  computation in order to expedite the training process. In addition to the networks performing  based on raw pixel data,Hybrid feature strategy is employed by which trained a novel CNN model  with the combination of raw pixel data and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. To  reduce the over fitting of the models,different techniques are utilized including dropout and batch  normalization in addition to L2 regularization. Cross validation is applied to determine the optimal  hyper-parameters and evaluated the performance of the developed models by looking at their  training histories. Visualization of different layers of a network is presented to show what features  of a face can be learned by CNN models. Based on the emotion the program recommends the  music for the user to up flit the mood. | https://github.com/manyasrinivas2021/AI-BASED-FACIAL-EMOTION-DETECTION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING | 0 | 0|
