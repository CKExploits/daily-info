| 20200829T23:24:31Z | This project was created to practice fuzzing on embedded systems. The program is written in C for the ST Nucleo STMF4129ZI (STM32F429ZIT6 MCU). It controls a motion sensor, RFID reader, servo motor, and LCD screen to function as a %lock% mechanism, which is protected by RFID Keycards. The keycards are registered or deleted using the Python client program which communicates with the hardware via TCP protocol.  | https://github.com/lauren-vance/RFIDLock_Fuzz | 0 | 0|
