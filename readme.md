It has been further modified to incorporate a chat-room. Python 3 is used,so each and every message is encoded and sent where as the receiver has to decode that message to access it(unlike python2 where you can freely send message through sockets).   | https://github.com/Ary4/Discrete-Logarithm-encryption-in-Client-Server-Chatroom | 0 | 0|
