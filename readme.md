| 20211110T13:27:43Z | With this project, I want to make a blending between Persevere and taPCT. The idea is to find bugs in large amounts of concurrent threading instruction. For that we will first try and identify with this tool some known bugs from emac versions that were not yet corrected. We first model the system call as a set of events and then apply the taPCT algorithm. Later on, we can use fuzzing to give larger system call sequences to our probabilistic scheduling algorithm.  | https://github.com/Ricagraca/taPPCT | 0 | 0|

| 20211110T13:15:34Z | Wind energy has gained an increasing worldwide interest due to the continuous increase in fuel cost and the need to have a clean source of energy. The main objective of most of the wind energy systems is to extract the maximum power available in the wind stream. However, the wind regime varies continuously and thus the system controllers should be updated to follow these variations. This paper is intended to apply fuzzy logic control techniques to overcome the effect of the wind speed variations on the parameters of the wind turbines and their controllers | https://github.com/navinkryadav/wind-energy-fuzzy-control | 0 | 0|
