| 20211029T12:45:27Z | After many requests, our team created a new Silent DOC Exploit for Microsoft Office. The purpose of this exploit is to silently infect victims upon opening the document. Furthermore, this exploit will convert an .EXE to .DOC or .XLS without any detection‚Äôs from antivirus. In addition, we guarantee the exploit is FUD for the entirety of your subscription. Furthermore, this is a private exploit by our team of 0Day Developers. Our method is completely new and we guarantee success with all subscriptions.  Using this exploit alongside one of our great Botnets will be very effective. | https://github.com/attakercyebr/exploit-doc-product-box | 0 | 0|
