| 20201021T11:15:42Z | AgroTrust is a blockchain enabled traceability solution with the aim of integrating of global food value chains. Small landholding farmers across the country are suffering due to fragile market linkages, weak bargaining power, exploitation by middlemen and high spillage & spoilage. On the other end, consumers are rarely aware about agricultural products they consume, their quality, safety, and sustainability. They are even more oblivious about how much of their paid price goes back to the farmer. Only when the farmer knows the complete story of his product from farm to fork and the consumer knows the complete story of his food from fork to farm, these problems could be addressed. Only when the both ends of the value chain – the farmer and the consumer – are aware about each other, will the players in the middle be incentivized to ensure better products and fair prices. | https://github.com/ganeshanantwar/AgroTrust-QRiosity | 0 | 0|
