| 20210831T10:50:50Z | CVE-2021-3490 | Null | https://github.com/chompie1337/Linux_LPE_eBPF_CVE-2021-3490 | The eBPF ALU32 bounds tracking for bitwise ops (AND, OR and XOR) in the Linux kernel did not properly update 32-bit bounds, which could be turned into out of bounds reads and writes in the Linux kernel and therefore, arbitrary code execution. This issue was fixed via commit 049c4e13714e (%bpf: Fix alu32 const subreg bound tracking on bitwise operations%) (v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. The AND/OR issues were introduced by commit 3f50f132d840 (%bpf: Verifier, do explicit ALU32 bounds tracking%) (5.7-rc1) and the XOR variant was introduced by 2921c90d4718 (%bpf:Fix a verifier failure with xor%) ( 5.10-rc1).|

| 20210831T09:19:40Z | The availability of open Earth observation (EO) data through the Copernicus and Landsat programs, as well as plethora of commercially available satellite imagery, represents an unprecedented resource for many EO applications, ranging from ocean and land use/land cover monitoring to disaster control, emergency services and humanitarian relief. Large amounts of such spatiotemporal data call for tools that are able to automatically extract complex patterns embedded inside.  eo-learn is a collection of open source Python packages that have been developed to seamlessly access and process spatio-temporal satellite imagery in a timely and automatic manner. It makes the extraction of valuable information from satellite imagery as easy as defining a sequence of operations to be performed on satellite imagery. It also encourages collaboration --- the tasks and workflows can be shared, thus allowing for community-driven ways to exploit EO data.  The eo-learn library acts as a bridge between the Earth Observation (EO)/Remote Sensing (RS) field and the Python ecosystem for data science and machine learning. It lowers the entry barrier to the field of RS for non-experts and simultaneously brings the state-of-the-art tools for computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning existing in Python ecosystem to remote sensing experts.  AquaCyder aims on tasks like dealing with retrieving the EO data (e.g. Sentinel-2), processing it, adding non-EO data (e.g. labels) to the dataset etc. and finally build the whole pipeline to run such workflow thus preparing the data for ML algorithms for all the water bodies in INDIA, using eo-learn framework | https://github.com/yuktachikate/AquaCyder-NEERI | 0 | 0|
