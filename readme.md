| 20210929T11:59:00Z | In this project, I deployed and assessed a simple web application environment’s security posture. I will test the security of the environment by simulating an attack scenario and exploiting cloud configuration vulnerabilities. I%ll also set up monitoring to identify suspicious behavior and vulnerable configurations and you will remediate the identified misconfigurations. Finally, i will tie it all together by proposing a DevOps build pipeline that includes security best practices. | https://github.com/YoussefBayouli/AWS-Cloud-Security---Protecting-Resources-and-Data-in-the-Cloud | 0 | 0|
