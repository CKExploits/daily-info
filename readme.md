| 20210913T12:16:01Z | CVE-2021-40222 | Remote Code Execution at Rittal | https://github.com/asang17/CVE-2021-40222 | Rittal CMC PU III Web management Version affected: V3.11.00_2. Version fixed: V3.17.10 is affected by a remote code execution vulnerablity. It is possible to introduce shell code to create a reverse shell in the PU-Hostname field of the TCP/IP Configuration dialog. Web application fails to sanitize user input on Network TCP/IP configuration page. This allows the attacker to inject commands as root on the device which will be executed once the data is received.| 
| 20210913T12:15:32Z | CVE-2021-40223 | XSS Vulnerability in Rittal | https://github.com/asang17/CVE-2021-40223 | Rittal CMC PU III Web management (version V3.11.00_2) fails to sanitize user input on several parameters of the configuration (User Configuration dialog, Task Configuration dialog and set logging filter dialog). This allows an attacker to backdoor the device with HTML and browser-interpreted content (such as JavaScript or other client-side scripts). The XSS payload will be triggered when the user accesses some specific sections of the application.|

The endpoints allowed for uploading arbitrary files to the uploads/workreap-temp directory. Uploaded files were neither sanitized nor validated, allowing an unauthenticated visitor to upload executable code such as php scripts.|
