| 20211205T07:50:39Z | During the exploitation phase of a pen test or ethical hacking engagement, you will ultimately need to try to cause code to run on target system computers. Whether accomplished by phishing emails, delivering a payload through an exploit, or social engineering, running code on target computers is part of most penetration tests. That means that you will need to be able to bypass antivirus software or other host-based protection for successful exploitation. The most effective way to avoid antivirus detection on your target%s computers is to create your own customized backdoor. Here is a simple way to evade anti-virus software when creating backdoors! | https://github.com/RoseSecurity/Anti-Virus-Evading-Payloads | 28 | 4|

| 20211205T20:19:29Z | With this project, I want to make a blending between Persevere and taPCT. The idea is to find bugs in large amounts of concurrent threading instruction. For that we will first try and identify with this tool some known bugs from emac versions that were not yet corrected. We first model the system call as a set of events and then apply the taPCT algorithm. Later on, we can use fuzzing to give larger system call sequences to our probabilistic scheduling algorithm.  | https://github.com/Ricagraca/taPPCT | 0 | 0|
