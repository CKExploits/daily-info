| 20210825T09:10:46Z | This program uses a system call dependency graph to detect malware and analyze their behavior. First, the software under examination is executed and system calls are extracted. A dependency graph is built from these system calls and a set of features for each software is extracted to specify the software behavior. A feature selection method is implemented to reduce the number of features by clustering them. Machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks are exploited to build two prediction models. The first model is a two-class model that classifies software into malware and regular software. The second model is a multi-class model, which identifies the type of malware, in addition to classifying the software to malware and regular software. These two models are evaluated using data collected by Fredrickson and et.al. | https://github.com/MahsaSinaei/Malware-detection-by-system-call-graph-using-Machine-Learning | 0 | 0|
