| 20220325T11:24:14Z | During the exploitation phase of a pen test or ethical hacking engagement, you will ultimately need to try to cause code to run on target system computers. Whether accomplished by phishing emails, delivering a payload through an exploit, or social engineering, running code on target computers is part of most penetration tests. That means that you will need to be able to bypass antivirus software or other host-based protection for successful exploitation. The most effective way to avoid antivirus detection on your target%s computers is to create your own customized backdoor.

| 20220325T09:53:28Z | The twin-spool turbofan engine is an important component of almost every modern aircraft. Fault detection at an early stage can improve engine performance and health. The current research is based on the construction of an inference system for fault diagnosis in a generalized fuzzy environment. For such an inference system, finite-state deterministic intuitionistic fuzzy automata (FDIFA) are established. A semigroup of FDIFA and its algebraic properties including substructures and structure-preserving maps are studied. The FDIFA semigroups are used as variables for the inference system, and FDIFA semigroup homomorphisms are used to indicate the relation between variables. The newly established model is then applied to diagnose the possible fault and their nature in aircraft twin-spool turbofan engines by modelling the performance of the supercharger and air cooler. | https://github.com/waynethalle/fuzzy-octo-engine | 0 | 0|
