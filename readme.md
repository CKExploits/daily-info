| 20210716T10:06:37Z | CVE-2021-22555 | CVE-2021-22555 Exploit | https://github.com/JustYoomoon/CVE-2021-22555-Exploit | A heap out-of-bounds write affecting Linux since v2.6.19-rc1 was discovered in net/netfilter/x_tables.c. This allows an attacker to gain privileges or cause a DoS (via heap memory corruption) through user name space| 
| 20210716T04:04:35Z | CVE-2021-3493 | CVE-2021-3493 Ubuntu漏洞 | https://github.com/derek-turing/CVE-2021-3493 | The overlayfs implementation in the linux kernel did not properly validate with respect to user namespaces the setting of file capabilities on files in an underlying file system. Due to the combination of unprivileged user namespaces along with a patch carried in the Ubuntu kernel to allow unprivileged overlay mounts, an attacker could use this to gain elevated privileges.|
