| 20200713T20:19:18Z | HGB is a plugin that adds a Global Ban system to your server. Have you heard of CAX Bans? This is it, but Community-Edition™️. Malicious individuals such as cheaters, minge-groups, etc are added to this list and get banned from each server that has this plugin installed. The ban list is managed by me, and only I can add onto the list, so it is not exploitable in any way. The plugin also features a %Version Control% system. If there is ever a new version of the plugin released, you will see a message on your server console when you start up your server. | https://github.com/Aspect12/HHubGlobalBan | 0 | 0|
