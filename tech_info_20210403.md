| 20210403T12:10:03Z | CVE-2021-21972 | Null | https://github.com/password520/CVE-2021-21972 | The vSphere Client (HTML5) contains a remote code execution vulnerability in a vCenter Server plugin. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server. This affects VMware vCenter Server (7.x before 7.0 U1c, 6.7 before 6.7 U3l and 6.5 before 6.5 U3n) and VMware Cloud Foundation (4.x before 4.2 and 3.x before 3.10.1.2).| 
| 20210403T10:07:21Z | cve-2021-3449 | CVE-2021-3449 OpenSSL denial-of-service exploit üë®üèª‚Äçüíª | https://github.com/terorie/cve-2021-3449 | An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1j).| 
| 20210403T08:56:32Z | CVE-2021-21975 | [CVE-2021-21975] VMware vRealize Operations Manager API Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | https://github.com/murataydemir/CVE-2021-21975 | Server Side Request Forgery in vRealize Operations Manager API (CVE-2021-21975) prior to 8.4 may allow a malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can perform a Server Side Request Forgery attack to steal administrative credentials.| 
| 20210403T02:35:05Z | CVE-2021-3156 | Sudo Baron Samedit Exploit | https://github.com/worawit/CVE-2021-3156 | Sudo before 1.9.5p2 contains an off-by-one error that can result in a heap-based buffer overflow, which allows privilege escalation to root via %sudoedit -s% and a command-line argument that ends with a single backslash character.|
