| 20220503T23:46:28Z | Nonlinear Marine Predator Algorithm (NMPA) NMPA an influential attempt to identify and alleviate some of the issues with the recently proposed optimization technique called the Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA). With a visual investigation of its exploratory and exploitative behavior, it is observed that the transition of search from being global to local can be further improved. As an extremely cost-effective method, a set of nonlinear functions is used to change the search patterns of the MPA algorithm. The proposed algorithm is called Nonlinear Marin Predator Algorithm (NMPA) is tested on a set of benchmark functions. A comprehensive comparative study shows the superiority of the proposed method compared to the original MPA and even other recent meta-heuristics. The paper also considers solving a real-world case study around power allocation in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and visible light communications (VLC) for Beyond 5G (B5G) networks to showcase the applicability of the NMPA algorithm. NMPA algorithm shows its superiority in solving a wide range of benchmark functions as well as obtaining fair power allocation for multiple users in NOMA-VLC-B5G systems compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Tender calamari, creamy, slightly chewy pearl couscous in a rich, flavourful tomato sauce. Think risotto without the time and effort!  I’ve used calamari, but feel free to substitute shrimp, clams or mussels in the dish. All are great alternatives.  Tomato passata, onion, garlic, a little white wine infused with saffron come together in a simple sauce made fragrant and spicy with the addition of cayenne, paprika, turmeric and cumin.  While the sauce cooks, the pearl couscous is toasted a minute or two in some olive oil, then simmered until soft and tender. The cooked couscous is stirred into the sauce, where it absorbs all the delicious flavours from the spices.  The calamari are briefly sautéed calamari, then added to the sauce at the last minute. A good handful of fresh basil completes the dish.  Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and a few fresh basil leaves on top. | https://github.com/ShashankDeep1/fuzzy-octo-couscous | 0 | 0|
