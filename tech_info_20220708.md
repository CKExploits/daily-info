| 20220708T11:20:00Z | Cve-2022- | This repo provides a nice and easy way for linking an existing NFT smart contract to this minting dapp. There are two ways of using this repo, you can go the simple route or the more complex one.  The simple route is so simple, all you need to do is download the build folder on the release page and change the configuration to fit your needs. (Follow the video for a walk through).  The more complex route allows you to add additional functionality if you are comfortable with coding in react.js.

| 20220708T11:11:29Z | # Relay-Attack-Unit-for-cars-with-keyless-systems Many new cars now have keyless entry systems, or can have them added as an upgrade. This allows the driver to open and start the car without using a button or turning a key so long as the fob is nearby.  Thieves are exploiting this, using relay attack technology to hack into every car with keyless%s computer, meaning they don’t even need a key-fob to start the vehicle and can drive it away in a matter of seconds.A relay attack usually involves two people working together. One stands by the targeted vehicle, while the other stands near the house with a device that can pick up a signal from the key fob.The device then relays the key fob’s signal directly to the car, allowing the thieves to get in and drive away immediately. The price of 1 unit is 1,000 euros. Here%s a video of how it works : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAaG7Rs5zKw | https://github.com/nonamee71/Relay-attack-for-keyless-cars | 0 | 0|
