| 20201009T11:36:39Z | A new approach to video compression for video surveillance by refining the shortcomings of conventional approach and substitute each traditional component with their neural network counterpart. Our proposed work consists of motion estimation, compression and compensation and residue compression, learned end-to-end to minimize the rate-distortion trade off. The whole model is jointly optimized using a single loss function. Our work is based on a standard method to exploit the spatio-temporal redundancy in video frames to reduce the bit rate along with the minimization of distortions in decoded frames. We implement a neural network version of conventional video compression approach and encode the redundant frames with lower number of bit. | https://github.com/tukilabs/Video-Compression-Net | 3 | 1|
