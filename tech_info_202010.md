It uses Levenshtein Distance to calculate the differences between sequences. python-Levenshtein provides a 4-10x speedup in String Matching. the Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.
