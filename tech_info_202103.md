| 20210305T07:15:39Z | In this project we%ll be exploring how to attack, detect and defend against bypassing User Account Control (UAC). Granting local admin rights to users is generally a bad idea, but if you really have to, UAC can help reduce that risk a bit – but probably not as much as you think.in one word our project is “Defeating Windows User Account Control by abusing built-in Windows Auto Elevate backdoor.” User Account Control asks for credentials in a Secure Desktop mode, where the entire screen is temporarily dimmed, Windows Aero disabled, and only the authorization window at full brightness, to present only the elevation user interface (UI). Normal applications cannot interact with the Secure Desktop. This helps prevent spoofing, such as overlaying different text or graphics on top of the elevation request, or tweaking the mouse pointer to click the confirmation button when that%s not what the user intended Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system. Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action. If the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs can elevate privileges or execute some elevated Component Object Model objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box. An example of this is use of Rundll32 to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto elevated Component Object Model object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access. Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting a user. There are many ways to perform UAC bypasses when a user is in the local administrator group on a system, so it may be difficult to target detection on all variations. Efforts should likely be placed on mitigation and collecting enough information on process launches and actions that could be performed before and after a UAC bypass is performed. Monitor process API calls for behavior that may be indicative of Process Injection and unusual loaded DLLs through DLL Search Order Hijacking, which indicate attempts to gain access to higher privileged processes | https://github.com/sumo2001/Bypassing-User-Access-Control-UAC- | 0 | 0| 
| 20210305T07:05:00Z | The aim of this project is to explore the hypothesis of a computer virus threat, and how destructive it can be if executed on a targeted machine. What are the possible counter measures to protect computers from these threats? Information security risks associated with computer viruses can infect computers and other storage devices by copying themselves into a file and other executable programs. These files get infection and allow attackers to connect to target systems by using backdoors. The results of this project show that, the proper security implementations and the use of up to date operating systems patches and anti-virus programs helps users to prevent the loss of data and any viral attack on the system. Nevertheless, this observation could be used for further research in the network security and related fields; this study will also help computer users to use the possible steps and techniques to protect their systems and information from any possible attacks on their network systems. | https://github.com/sumo2001/Binding-payload-within-images | 0 | 0|
