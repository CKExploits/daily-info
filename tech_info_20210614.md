| 20210614T08:58:55Z | CVE-2021-33739 | Null | https://github.com/mavillon1/CVE-2021-33739-POC | Microsoft DWM Core Library Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability| 
| 20210614T08:16:05Z | CVE-2021-3560 | Null | https://github.com/deathflash1411/CVE-2021-3560 | 未查询到CVE信息| 
| 20210614T07:36:50Z | CVE-2020-3452 | Null | https://github.com/sujaygr8/CVE-2020-3452 | A vulnerability in the web services interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks and read sensitive files on a targeted system. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.| 
| 20210614T07:30:41Z | CVE-2021-22911 | Pre-Auth Blind NoSQL Injection leading to Remote Code Execution in Rocket Chat 3.12.1 | https://github.com/CsEnox/CVE-2021-22911 | A improper input sanitization vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat server 3.11, 3.12 & 3.13 that could lead to unauthenticated NoSQL injection, resulting potentially in RCE.| 
| 20210614T06:56:19Z | CVE-2021-31166 | Proof of concept for CVE-2021-31166, a remote HTTP.sys use-after-free triggered remotely. | https://github.com/0vercl0k/CVE-2021-31166 | HTTP Protocol Stack Remote Code Execution Vulnerability| 
| 20210614T06:46:19Z | CVE-2020-3187 | Null | https://github.com/sujaygr8/CVE-2020-3187 | A vulnerability in the web services interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks and obtain read and delete access to sensitive files on a targeted system. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of the HTTP URL. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences. An exploit could allow the attacker to view or delete arbitrary files on the targeted system. When the device is reloaded after exploitation of this vulnerability, any files that were deleted are restored. The attacker can only view and delete files within the web services file system. This file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability can not be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files. Reloading the affected device will restore all files within the web services file system.|
