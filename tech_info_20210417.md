| 20210417T11:45:38Z | CVE-2021-29447 | Null | https://github.com/motikan2010/CVE-2021-29447 | Wordpress is an open source CMS. A user with the ability to upload files (like an Author) can exploit an XML parsing issue in the Media Library leading to XXE attacks. This requires WordPress installation to be using PHP 8. Access to internal files is possible in a successful XXE attack. This has been patched in WordPress version 5.7.1, along with the older affected versions via a minor release. We strongly recommend you keep auto-updates enabled.|

Access is restricted to files accessible by the JobManager process. All users should upgrade to Flink 1.11.3 or 1.12.0 if their Flink instance(s) are exposed. The issue was fixed in commit b561010b0ee741543c3953306037f00d7a9f0801 from apache/flink:master.|

| 20210417T09:28:38Z | Abstract: The Bellman operator constitutes the foundation for the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. An alternative is presented by the Gauss-Seidel version of the DP algorithm, which, in contrast to the Bellman operator, updates one state at a time, while incorporating into the computation the interim results. The provably faster algorithmic convergence of the Gauss-Seidel version comes at the price of an inherent sequentiality, which prevents from the exploitation of modern multi-core systems. The project first introduces the new operator, namely, the Randomized Mini-Batch Gauss-Seidel operator, which aims at realizing the trade-off between the faster convergence of the Gauss-Seidel DP algorithm and the parallelization capability offered by the Bellman operator. After the introduction of the new operator, a theoretical analysis for validating its fundamental properties is conducted, which allows to successfully deploy it in the main dynamic programming schemes. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis compares the convergence of the DP algorithm based on the new operator with that of the counterparts, shedding lights on the algorithmic advantages of the new formulation. Finally, an extensive experimental evaluation of the newly introduced operator is conducted when used in the modified policy iteration and value iteration methods. In accordance with the theoretical derivations, the numerical results show the competitive performance of the proposed operator and its superior flexibility, which allows to adapt the efficiency of its iterations to different structures of MDPs and hardware setups.   | https://github.com/maxmartinezruts/Randomized-Mini-Batch-Gauss-Seidel-Operator | 0 | 0|
