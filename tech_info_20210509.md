| 20210509T22:55:27Z | CVE-2021-30165 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-30165 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2021-30165 | The default administrator account & password of the EDIMAX wireless network camera is hard-coded. Remote attackers can disassemble firmware to obtain the privileged permission and further control the devices.| 
| 20210509T22:55:23Z | CVE-2020-36326 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-36326 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2020-36326 | PHPMailer 6.1.8 through 6.4.0 allows object injection through Phar Deserialization via addAttachment with a UNC pathname. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2018-19296, but arose because 6.1.8 fixed a functionality problem in which UNC pathnames were always considered unreadable by PHPMailer, even in safe contexts. As an unintended side effect, this fix eliminated the code that blocked addAttachment exploitation.| 
| 20210509T22:55:20Z | CVE-2021-31826 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-31826 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2021-31826 | Shibboleth Service Provider 3.x before 3.2.2 is prone to a NULL pointer dereference flaw involving the session recovery feature.

The current security vulnerability allows access to keys and buckets through a curl command or an unauthenticated HTTP request. This enables unauthorized access to buckets and keys thereby exposing data to anonymous clients or users. This affected Apache Ozone prior to the 1.1.0 release.|
