| 20210509T06:54:11Z | CVE-2021-21349 | XStream SSRF CVE-2021-21349 | https://github.com/s-index/CVE-2021-21349 | XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a remote attacker to request data from internal resources that are not publicly available only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream%s security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream%s default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.|

In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is vulnerability which may allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected who followed the recommendation to setup XStream%s security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream%s default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.|
