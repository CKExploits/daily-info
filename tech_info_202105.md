Local authenticated user access is required.| 
| 20210530T06:24:51Z | CVE-2021-21389 | BuddyPress < 7.2.1 - REST API Privilege Escalation to RCE | https://github.com/HoangKien1020/CVE-2021-21389 | BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it%s possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.| 
| 20210529T12:34:35Z | CVE-2020-8813 | Cacti v1.2.8 Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution | https://github.com/hexcowboy/CVE-2020-8813 | | 
| 20210529T10:48:57Z | CVE-2021-3156 | CVE-2021-3156: Sudo heap overflow exploit for Debain 10 | https://github.com/0xdevil/CVE-2021-3156 | Sudo before 1.9.5p2 contains an off-by-one error that can result in a heap-based buffer overflow, which allows privilege escalation to root via %sudoedit -s% and a command-line argument that ends with a single backslash character.| 
| 20210529T08:12:06Z | CVE-2021-20717 | CVE-2021-20717-EC-CUBE-XSS | https://github.com/s-index/CVE-2021-20717 | Cross-site scripting vulnerability in EC-CUBE 4.0.0 to 4.0.5 allows a remote attacker to inject a specially crafted script in the specific input field of the EC web site which is created using EC-CUBE. As a result, it may lead to an arbitrary script execution on the administrator%s web browser.| 
| 20210528T23:42:13Z | CVE-2021-33564 | Argument Injection in Dragonfly Ruby Gem | https://github.com/mlr0p/CVE-2021-33564 | An argument injection vulnerability in the Dragonfly gem before 1.4.0 for Ruby allows remote attackers to read and write to arbitrary files via a crafted URL when the verify_url option is disabled. This may lead to code execution. The problem occurs because the generate and process features mishandle use of the ImageMagick convert utility.| 
| 20210528T16:54:31Z | CVE-2021-29629 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-29629 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2021-29629 | In FreeBSD 13.0-STABLE before n245765-bec0d2c9c841, 12.2-STABLE before r369859, 11.4-STABLE before r369866, 13.0-RELEASE before p1, 12.2-RELEASE before p7, and 11.4-RELEASE before p10, missing message validation in libradius(3) could allow malicious clients or servers to trigger denial of service in vulnerable servers or clients respectively.| 
| 20210528T16:54:26Z | CVE-2020-27208 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-27208 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2020-27208 | The flash read-out protection (RDP) level is not enforced during the device initialization phase of the SoloKeys Solo 4.0.0 & Somu and the Nitrokey FIDO2 token. This allows an adversary to downgrade the RDP level and access secrets such as private ECC keys from SRAM via the debug interface.| 
| 20210528T16:54:25Z | CVE-2021-29628 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-29628 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2021-29628 | In FreeBSD 13.0-STABLE before n245764-876ffe28796c, 12.2-STABLE before r369857, 13.0-RELEASE before p1, and 12.2-RELEASE before p7, a system call triggering a fault could cause SMAP protections to be disabled for the duration of the system call. This weakness could be combined with other kernel bugs to craft an exploit.| 
| 20210528T16:54:21Z | CVE-2020-12061 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-12061 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2020-12061 | An issue was discovered in Nitrokey FIDO U2F firmware through 1.1. Communication between the microcontroller and the secure element transmits credentials in plain. This allows an adversary to eavesdrop the communication and derive the secrets stored in the microcontroller. As a result, the attacker is able to arbitrarily manipulate the firmware of the microcontroller.|
