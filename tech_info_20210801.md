| 20210801T11:36:24Z | CVE-2021-3490 | Null | https://github.com/chompie1337/Linux_LPE_eBPF_CVE-2021-3490 | The eBPF ALU32 bounds tracking for bitwise ops (AND, OR and XOR) in the Linux kernel did not properly update 32-bit bounds, which could be turned into out of bounds reads and writes in the Linux kernel and therefore, arbitrary code execution. This issue was fixed via commit 049c4e13714e (%bpf: Fix alu32 const subreg bound tracking on bitwise operations%) (v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. The AND/OR issues were introduced by commit 3f50f132d840 (%bpf: Verifier, do explicit ALU32 bounds tracking%) (5.7-rc1) and the XOR variant was introduced by 2921c90d4718 (%bpf:Fix a verifier failure with xor%) ( 5.10-rc1).|
