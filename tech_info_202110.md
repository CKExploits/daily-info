| 20211001T21:26:09Z | CVE-2021-21569 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-21569 : Dell NetWorker, versions 18.x and 19.x contain a Path traversal vulnerability. A NetWorker server user with remote access to NetWorker clients may potentially exploit this vulnerability and gain access to unauthorized information. | https://github.com/AlAIAL90/CVE-2021-21569 | | 
| 20211001T21:25:50Z | CVE-2021-21570 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-21570 : Dell NetWorker, versions 18.x and 19.x contain an Information disclosure vulnerability. A NetWorker server user with remote access to NetWorker clients may potentially exploit this vulnerability and gain access to unauthorized information. | https://github.com/AlAIAL90/CVE-2021-21570 | | 
| 20211001T21:25:20Z | CVE-2021-24604 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-24604 : The Availability Calendar WordPress plugin before 1.2.2 does not sanitise or escape its Category Names before outputting them in page/post where the associated shortcode is embed, allowing high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html is disallowed | https://github.com/AlAIAL90/CVE-2021-24604 | | 
| 20211001T21:25:15Z | CVE-2021-36286 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-36286 : Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin. | https://github.com/AlAIAL90/CVE-2021-36286 | | 
| 20211001T21:25:04Z | CVE-2021-24613 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-24613 : The Post Views Counter WordPress plugin before 1.3.5 does not sanitise or escape its Post Views Label settings, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks in the frontend even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed | https://github.com/AlAIAL90/CVE-2021-24613 | | 
| 20211001T21:25:01Z | CVE-2021-40690 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-40690 : All versions of Apache Santuario - XML Security for Java prior to 2.2.3 and 2.1.7 are vulnerable to an issue where the "secureValidation" property is not passed correctly when creating a KeyInfo from a KeyInfoReference element. This allows an attacker to abuse an XPath Transform to extract any local .xml files in a RetrievalMethod element. | https://github.com/AlAIAL90/CVE-2021-40690 | | 
| 20211001T21:24:56Z | CVE-2021-24583 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-24583 : The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.2 does not have proper access control when deleting a timeslot, allowing any user with the edit_posts capability (contributor+) to delete arbitrary timeslot from any events. Furthermore, no CSRF check is in place as well, allowing such attack to be performed via CSRF against a logged in with such capability | https://github.com/AlAIAL90/CVE-2021-24583 | | 
| 20211001T21:24:53Z | CVE-2021-24600 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-24600 : The WP Dialog WordPress plugin through 1.2.5.5 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings before outputting them in pages, allowing high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed. | https://github.com/AlAIAL90/CVE-2021-24600 | | 
| 20211001T21:24:49Z | CVE-2021-24606 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-24606 : The Availability Calendar WordPress plugin before 1.2.1 does not escape the category attribute from its shortcode before using it in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL Injection issue, which can be exploited by any user able to add shortcode to posts/pages, such as contributor+ | https://github.com/AlAIAL90/CVE-2021-24606 | | 
| 20211001T21:24:45Z | CVE-2021-24584 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-24584 : The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.2 does not have proper access control when updating a timeslot, allowing any user with the edit_posts capability (contributor+) to update arbitrary timeslot from any events. Furthermore, no CSRF check is in place as well, allowing such attack to be perform via CSRF against a logged in with such capability. In versions before 2.3.19, the lack of sanitisation and escaping in some of the fields, like the descritption could also lead to Stored XSS issues | https://github.com/AlAIAL90/CVE-2021-24584 | |
