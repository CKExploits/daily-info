As the Red Team, we attacked a vulnerable VM within our environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, we used Kibana to review logs. We also used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for our report. Then, we interpreted our log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that we successfully performed. | https://github.com/itscarlosm/Red-vs-Blue-Project | 0 | 0|
