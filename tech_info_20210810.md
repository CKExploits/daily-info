| 20210810T10:18:29Z | CVE-2021-27905 | [CVE-2021-27905] Apache Solr ReplicationHandler Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | https://github.com/murataydemir/CVE-2021-27905 | The ReplicationHandler (normally registered at %/replication% under a Solr core) in Apache Solr has a %masterUrl% (also %leaderUrl% alias) parameter that is used to designate another ReplicationHandler on another Solr core to replicate index data into the local core. To prevent a SSRF vulnerability, Solr ought to check these parameters against a similar configuration it uses for the %shards% parameter. Prior to this bug getting fixed, it did not. This problem affects essentially all Solr versions prior to it getting fixed in 8.8.2.|
