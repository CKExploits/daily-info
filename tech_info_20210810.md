| 20210810T10:18:29Z | CVE-2021-27905 | [CVE-2021-27905] Apache Solr ReplicationHandler Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | https://github.com/murataydemir/CVE-2021-27905 | The ReplicationHandler (normally registered at %/replication% under a Solr core) in Apache Solr has a %masterUrl% (also %leaderUrl% alias) parameter that is used to designate another ReplicationHandler on another Solr core to replicate index data into the local core. To prevent a SSRF vulnerability, Solr ought to check these parameters against a similar configuration it uses for the %shards% parameter. Prior to this bug getting fixed, it did not. This problem affects essentially all Solr versions prior to it getting fixed in 8.8.2.| 
| 20210810T07:27:44Z | CVE-2020-1020 | Windows Font Driver Type 1 VToHOrigin stack corruption | https://github.com/KaLendsi/CVE-2020-1020 | A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library improperly handles a specially-crafted multi-master font - Adobe Type 1 PostScript format.For all systems except Windows 10, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute code remotely, aka %Adobe Font Manager Library Remote Code Execution Vulnerability%. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2020-0938.|
