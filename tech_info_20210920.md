| 20210920T12:43:07Z | CVE-2021-21315 | Null | https://github.com/alikarimi999/CVE-2021-21315 | The System Information Library for Node.JS (npm package %systeminformation%) is an open source collection of functions to retrieve detailed hardware, system and OS information. In systeminformation before version 5.3.1 there is a command injection vulnerability. Problem was fixed in version 5.3.1. As a workaround instead of upgrading, be sure to check or sanitize service parameters that are passed to si.inetLatency(), si.inetChecksite(), si.services(), si.processLoad() ... do only allow strings, reject any arrays. String sanitation works as expected.| 
| 20210920T12:10:53Z | CVE-2021-26084 | [CVE-2021-26084] Confluence pre-auth RCE test script | https://github.com/ludy-dev/CVE-2021-26084_PoC | In affected versions of Confluence Server and Data Center, an OGNL injection vulnerability exists that would allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance. The affected versions are before version 6.13.23, from version 6.14.0 before 7.4.11, from version 7.5.0 before 7.11.6, and from version 7.12.0 before 7.12.5.|

| 20210920T09:58:19Z | CVE-2021-24499 | Mass exploitation of CVE-2021-24499 unauthenticated upload leading to remote code execution in Workreap theme. | https://github.com/RyouYoo/CVE-2021-24499 | The Workreap WordPress theme before 2.2.2 AJAX actions workreap_award_temp_file_uploader and workreap_temp_file_uploader did not perform nonce checks, or validate that the request is from a valid user in any other way. The endpoints allowed for uploading arbitrary files to the uploads/workreap-temp directory. Uploaded files were neither sanitized nor validated, allowing an unauthenticated visitor to upload executable code such as php scripts.|
