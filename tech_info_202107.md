This could lead to remote code execution over Bluetooth with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-8.0 Android-8.1 Android-9 Android-10Android ID: A-143894715| 
| 20210724T07:08:19Z | CVE-2021-23410 | Null | https://github.com/azu/msgpack-CVE-2021-23410-test | All versions of package msgpack are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data via the unpack function. N.B: this affects the NPM package [msgpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msgpack) only, NOT the more popular package [@msgpack/msgpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@msgpack/msgpack).| 
| 20210723T23:20:13Z | CVE-2020-15416 | https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-20-712/ | https://github.com/k3vinlusec/R7000_httpd_BOF_CVE-2020-15416 | This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of NETGEAR R6700 V1.0.4.84_10.0.58 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the httpd service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length, stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-9703.|

Applications that use the library to process untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by abusing the python/object/new constructor. This flaw is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-1747.|
