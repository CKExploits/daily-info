| 20210302T12:54:02Z | CVE-2021-21315 | CVE 2021-21315 PoC | https://github.com/ForbiddenProgrammer/CVE-2021-21315-PoC | The System Information Library for Node.JS (npm package %systeminformation%) is an open source collection of functions to retrieve detailed hardware, system and OS information. In systeminformation before version 5.3.1 there is a command injection vulnerability. Problem was fixed in version 5.3.1. As a workaround instead of upgrading, be sure to check or sanitize service parameters that are passed to si.inetLatency(), si.inetChecksite(), si.services(), si.processLoad() ... do only allow strings, reject any arrays. String sanitation works as expected.|
