| 20200729T10:48:45Z | Nanoscale L12-type ordered structures are commonly used in face-centred cubic (FCC) alloys to exploit their hardening capacity and thereby improve mechanical properties. These fine-scale particles are typically fully coherent with matrix with the same atomic configuration disregarding chemical species, which makes them challenging to be characterized. Spatial distribution maps (SDMs) are used to probe local order by interrogating the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of atoms within reconstructed atom probe tomography (APT) data. However, it is quite difficult and inefficient to manually analyse the complete point cloud in search for the partial crystallographic information retained within the data. Here, we proposed an intelligent L12-ordered structure recognition method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the first time. The SDMs of a simulated L12-ordered structure and of the FCC matrix were firstly generated. These simulated images combined with a small amount of experimental data were used to train a CNNs-based L12-ordered structure recognition model. Finally, the approach was successfully applied to reveal the 3D distribution of L12–type –Al3(LiMg) particles with an average radius of 3 nm in a FCC Al-Li-Mg system. The proposed method is promising to be extended to recognize other ordered structures in the future. | https://github.com/a356617605/Convolutional-neural-network-assisted-recognition-of-nanoscale-L12-ordered-structures-in-face-centre | 1 | 0|
