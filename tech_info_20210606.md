| 20210606T11:24:03Z | CVE-2021-27965 | stack based buffer overflow in MsIo64.sys, Proof of Concept Local Privilege Escalation to nt authority/system | https://github.com/mathisvickie/CVE-2021-27965 | The MsIo64.sys driver before 1.1.19.1016 in MSI Dragon Center before 2.0.98.0 has a buffer overflow that allows privilege escalation via a crafted 0x80102040, 0x80102044, 0x80102050, or 0x80102054 IOCTL request.|

| 20210606T08:51:32Z | CVE-2020-13957 | Apache Solr RCE CVE-2020-13957 | https://github.com/s-index/CVE-2020-13957 | Apache Solr versions 6.6.0 to 6.6.6, 7.0.0 to 7.7.3 and 8.0.0 to 8.6.2 prevents some features considered dangerous (which could be used for remote code execution) to be configured in a ConfigSet that%s uploaded via API without authentication/authorization. The checks in place to prevent such features can be circumvented by using a combination of UPLOAD/CREATE actions.| 
| 20210606T08:41:21Z | CVE-2021-25641 | Apache/Alibaba Dubbo <= 2.7.3 PoC Code for CVE-2021-25641 RCE via Deserialization of Untrusted Data; Affects Versions <= 2.7.6 With Different Gadgets | https://github.com/Dor-Tumarkin/CVE-2021-25641-Proof-of-Concept | Each Apache Dubbo server will set a serialization id to tell the clients which serialization protocol it is working on. But for Dubbo versions before 2.7.8 or 2.6.9, an attacker can choose which serialization id the Provider will use by tampering with the byte preamble flags, aka, not following the server%s instruction. This means that if a weak deserializer such as the Kryo and FST are somehow in code scope (e.g. if Kryo is somehow a part of a dependency), a remote unauthenticated attacker can tell the Provider to use the weak deserializer, and then proceed to exploit it.| 
| 20210606T08:09:03Z | CVE-2021-21551 | arbitrary kernel read/write in dbutil_2_3.sys, Proof of Concept Local Privilege Escalation to nt authority/system | https://github.com/mathisvickie/CVE-2021-21551 | Dell dbutil_2_3.sys driver contains an insufficient access control vulnerability which may lead to escalation of privileges, denial of service, or information disclosure. Local authenticated user access is required.| 
| 20210606T06:41:54Z | CVE-2021-21985 | Null | https://github.com/testanull/Project_CVE-2021-21985_PoC | The vSphere Client (HTML5) contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to lack of input validation in the Virtual SAN Health Check plug-in which is enabled by default in vCenter Server. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server.| 
| 20210606T05:59:51Z | CVE-2021-22205 | Null | https://github.com/mr-r3bot/Gitlab-CVE-2021-22205 | An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 11.9. GitLab was not properly validating image files that were passed to a file parser which resulted in a remote command execution.| 
| 20210606T03:42:20Z | CVE-2021-29440 | Unsafe Twig processing of static pages leading to RCE in Grav CMS 1.7.10 | https://github.com/CsEnox/CVE-2021-29440 | Grav is a file based Web-platform. Twig processing of static pages can be enabled in the front matter by any administrative user allowed to create or edit pages. As the Twig processor runs unsandboxed, this behavior can be used to gain arbitrary code execution and elevate privileges on the instance. The issue was addressed in version 1.7.11.|

| 20210606T12:19:20Z | NCHHO uses chaotic and nonlinear control parameters to improve HHO’s optimization performance. The main goal of using the chaotic maps in the proposed method is to improve the exploratory behavior of HHO. In addition, this paper introduces a nonlinear control parameter to adjust HHO’s exploratory and exploitative behaviours. The proposed NCHHO algorithm shows an improved performance using a variety of chaotic maps that were implemented to identify the most effective one, and tested on several well-known benchmark functions. Also, this work considers solving an Internet of Vehicles (IoV) optimization problem that showcases the applicability of NCHHO in solving large-scale, real-world problems. | https://github.com/alisafaa12/NCHHO_OptimizationAlgorithm_IoV_Application | 0 | 0|
