The affected versions are before version 7.13.6, from version 8.0.0 before 8.5.7, and from version 8.6.0 before 8.12.0.|

This functionality is intended for use in high-trust environments, and is disabled by default. However, in Druid 0.20.0 and earlier, it is possible for an authenticated user to send a specially-crafted request that forces Druid to run user-provided JavaScript code for that request, regardless of server configuration. This can be leveraged to execute code on the target machine with the privileges of the Druid server process.|

While this would most likely lead to an error and the closure of the HTTP/2 connection, it is possible that information could leak between requests.| 
| 20210205T00:01:23Z | CVE-2020-25213 | Null | https://github.com/forse01/CVE-2020-25213-Wordpress | The File Manager (wp-file-manager) plugin before 6.9 for WordPress allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code because it renames an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have the .php extension. This, for example, allows attackers to run the elFinder upload (or mkfile and put) command to write PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This was exploited in the wild in August and September 2020.|

| 20210206T22:39:38Z | This is my version of %Settlers of Catan%. The game is ostensibly complete with the exception of slow repainting when the robber is moved. Other than that, the game is functionally finished. The game plays best on a screen 1920x1080 as that enables status screens to be visible if 3-4 players are playing. A shortcut key has been implemented for cancellation of actions. Hold ALT_C when the Catan Board has focus, and this will enable an OptionPane to appear that allows for cancellation. And as for game additions I wanted to talk about, I have implemented a class system to the game that makes it more difficult (it is optional; choose the settler class if you want the standard game) as well as optional cataclysm events that can affect player resources at a 5% chance. As well, ports are optional as I%ve heard some people say they are too exploitable. Again, these three things are optional. And finally, all the image files used in this game are not my own. They are all sourced from Google Images (non-copyrighted, as far as I can tell). I will continue to work on the slow repaint issue in the future, but I will put this project down for a little while. (For whatever reason, I can%t put new lines in the description because of arbitrary code rules, so this jumbled mess of words is what I must put). | https://github.com/GitCaseyHub/SettlersOfCatan | 0 | 0|
