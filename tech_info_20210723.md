| 20210723T23:23:28Z | CVE-2020-0022 | This is a RCE bluetooth vulnerability on Android 8.0 and 9.0 | https://github.com/k3vinlusec/Bluefrag_CVE-2020-0022 | | 
| 20210723T23:20:13Z | CVE-2020-15416 | https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-20-712/ | https://github.com/k3vinlusec/R7000_httpd_BOF_CVE-2020-15416 | This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of NETGEAR R6700 V1.0.4.84_10.0.58 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the httpd service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length, stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-9703.| 
| 20210723T22:42:08Z | CVE-2021-33909 | Sequoia exploit (7/20/21) | https://github.com/Liang2580/CVE-2021-33909 | fs/seq_file.c in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.13.x before 5.13.4 does not properly restrict seq buffer allocations, leading to an integer overflow, an Out-of-bounds Write, and escalation to root by an unprivileged user, aka CID-8cae8cd89f05.| 
| 20210723T19:14:21Z | CVE-2021-36934 | CVE-2021-36934 PowerShell scripts | https://github.com/bytesizedalex/CVE-2021-36934 | Windows Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability|

| 20210723T15:46:41Z | CVE-2021-3156 | Sudo Baron Samedit Exploit | https://github.com/worawit/CVE-2021-3156 | Sudo before 1.9.5p2 contains an off-by-one error that can result in a heap-based buffer overflow, which allows privilege escalation to root via %sudoedit -s% and a command-line argument that ends with a single backslash character.| 
| 20210723T14:54:01Z | CVE-2020-14343 | Experimenting with the CVE-2020-14343 PyYAML vulnerability | https://github.com/raul23/pyyaml-CVE-2020-14343 | A vulnerability was discovered in the PyYAML library in versions before 5.4, where it is susceptible to arbitrary code execution when it processes untrusted YAML files through the full_load method or with the FullLoader loader. Applications that use the library to process untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by abusing the python/object/new constructor. This flaw is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-1747.| 
| 20210723T12:44:28Z | CVE-2021-1675 | C# and Impacket implementation of PrintNightmare CVE-2021-1675/CVE-2021-34527 | https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675 | |
