| 20211023T10:45:59Z | MD5 as it is, can be cracked and suffers from vulnerabilities such as collisions, due to which cases of exploitation have been reported where data has been compromised. The general hashing algorithms use iterations combined with the auxiliary functions to produce a pseudo random digest for the given message. Elliptic Curve Digest is the algorithm proposed in this paper. The ECD algorithm is based on the elliptic curve used in cryptography along with the iterative hash functions. This new approach significantly reduces the chances of finding collisions using traditional attacks by making the computation in-feasible. To mitigate the shortcomings of the previously used hashing functions like low collision resistance, Elliptic Curve Digest (ECD) is suggested, which accepts a message of variable length and gives a 256- bit digest. Hence, the proposed algorithm can be viewed as an amalgamation of the elliptic curve and the iterated hash structure. The Elliptic Curve Digest Algorithm will decrease the probability of collisions of the message digest and in the process rendering the collision attacks less feasible. | https://github.com/KastureeK/Elliptic-Curve-Digest | 0 | 0|
