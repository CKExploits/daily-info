| 20200920T11:46:35Z | The energy system transformation is facing the challenge of increasing decentralised renewable energy injec-tion into an infrastructure originally laid out for centralised, dispatchable power generation. Due to limited transmission capacity and flexibility, large amounts of renewable electricity are curtailed. In this paper,we assess how Power-to-Gas facilities can provide spatial and temporal flexibility by shifting pressure fromthe electricity grid to the gas infrastructure. For this purpose, we propose a two-stage model incorporating the day-head spot market and subsequent redispatch. We introduce Power-to-Gas as a redispatch optionand apply the model to the German electricity system. Instead of curtailing renewable electricity, syntheticn atural gas can be produced and injected into the gas grid for later usage. Results show a reduction on curtailment of renewables by 12 % through installing Power-to-Gas at a small set of nodes frequently facingcurtailment. With the benefits of decentralised synthetic natural gas injection and usage, we exploit theadvantages of coupling the two energy systems. The introduction of Power-to-Gas provides flexibility to the electricity system, while contributing to a higher effective utilisation of renewable energy sources as well as the natural gas grid. | https://github.com/bobbyxiong/redispatch-ptg | 0 | 0|
