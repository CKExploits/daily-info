| 20210524T23:37:25Z | It has been brought to my attention there is a player going around joining servers and discord’s claiming to be part of IllegalStack or otherwise representing me. There is NO such person, and they are trying to get server admins to download and run a modified version of this plugin that contains malicious code intended to take over or destroy the server it is run on. NEVER trust a file sent to you by anyone. I will NEVER join your server and ask you to install anything on your server. The ONLY place this plugin versions are uploaded is right here on github. There’s no special download site only download official releases posted here on github.READ ME FIRST!!!!   Protect your sever from over FIFTY glitches and dupes that have made it into final Spigot builds! This plugin supports all versions of Spigot from 1.8.8 to present. I try to keep it up to date with any new exploits that are found (from any version) So please feel free to contact me if you know of a vanilla game mechanic exploit that should be fixed! | https://github.com/sip-hub/illegal.fun | 0 | 0|
