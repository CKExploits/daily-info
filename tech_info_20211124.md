Students also will be exposed to the role of cryptography in computer security concept. After that, some mathematical techniques those needed in cryptography will be taught such as modular arithmetic, algebraic structure and prime numbers. The next topic is about the conventional type of cryptosystem covering the mono-alphabetic and poly-alphabetic ciphers. Modern cryptosystem such as RSA, El-Gamal, Rabin and Elliptic Curve cryptosystems will be introduced to the students in the next chapter. Some methods of security attacks also will be taught such as direct, exploiting an error and active attacks. The last topic in this course is Digital Signature. Variation and applications of Digital Signature will be emphasized. | https://github.com/kitkatlky/Cryptography | 0 | 0|
